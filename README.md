# edu.stanford.purl

This repository contains geospatial metadata from [EarthWorks](https://earthworks.stanford.edu), the Stanford University Libraries geoportal.

## Metadata

Metadata for geospatial data are provided in the following formats:

- geoblacklight.json -- [GeoBlacklight metadata](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/blob/master/schema/geoblacklight-schema.md)

Records in the Stanford digital repository are identified by a Digital Resource Unique Identifier (DRUID) in the format `druid:bb058zh0946`. Each record gets a corresponding permanent URL (PURL) page in the format [https://purl.stanford.edu/bb058zh0946](https://purl.stanford.edu/bb058zh0946). For objects that are available to download, this page hosts download links for the original data as well as metadata in various formats, like FGDC XML and ISO 19139 XML.
