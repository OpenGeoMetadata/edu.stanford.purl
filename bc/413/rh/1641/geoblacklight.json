  "dc_description_s": "The Satellite View with Shaded Relief of Hawaii map layer is a 100-meter resolution simulated natural-color image of Hawaii, with relief shading added to accentuate terrain features. Vegetation is generally green, with forests in darker green and grasslands or shrublands in lighter green. Areas of high reflectance, including urban areas, rock, and dry bare soil, are shown in shades of tan and pink. Very bright areas, such as snow and ice, are light blue. The image was produced by combining a mosaic of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery from the Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 satellites with shaded relief generated from 100-meter elevation data extracted from the National Elevation Dataset (NED). This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition National Atlas of the United States.The 100-meter resolution satellite view with shaded relief data were developed to portray the ground cover of the United States at 1:1,000,000 scale. The image is intended for visual purposes only. The original Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery data and NED elevation data should be used for conducting analysis. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.",
