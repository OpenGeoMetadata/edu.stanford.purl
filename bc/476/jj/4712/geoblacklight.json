  "dc_description_s": "This polyline shapefile depicts the Potential Flooding and Dam Inundation Zones on the Klamath River in the County of Humboldt, California in relation to the Iron Gate Dam. Flooding can cause the inundation of a normally dry area caused by high flow or overflow of water in an established watercourse. This coverage displays the portion of the Klamath River that flows from Siskiyou County, California to Humboldt, California where it drains into the Pacific Ocean. Fully constructed by 1962, the Iron Gate Dam is hydroelectric and stands 188 feet tall with a 58,000 acre feet reservoir capacity (Iron Gate Reservoir). This Dam is one of four in the Klamath Basin which have been proposed for removal. The lower and middle sections of the Klamath River in California are most vulnerable to flooding.The Humboldt County Planning and Building Department is responsible for protecting the public health, safety and welfare via building permit review and inspections consistent with California model codes as well as planning and development review and approval consistent with the county's General Plan. This Department oversees the Advance Planning Division, which is responsible for the Humboldt County's Geographic Information System (GIS) that is utilized by other County Departments; many federal, state and local agencies; and the general public. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
