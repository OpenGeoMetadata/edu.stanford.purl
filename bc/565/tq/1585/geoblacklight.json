Available at http://purl.stanford.edu/bc565tq1585. GIS Layer Number = 65/Original Source Map: Residential Exclusion Zone map included with County Code 13.20.071. Boundaries were copied onto paper maps of our parcel and road base. These boundaries were then converted to AutoCAD layers. The layer was made more accurate by removing areas within Scenic Resource Areas and areas within 100' of streams. \n\nSanta Cruz County Code Chapter 13.20: http://www.codepublishing.com/ca/santacruzcounty/html/SantaCruzCounty13/SantaCruzCounty1320.html These data were compiled from many different sources; therefore, the accuracy of the individual layers varies significantly, and some layers do not align exactly with others. In the urban areas, data are generally accurate within five to ten feet of their true geographic coordinates, but in the rural areas, data may be accurate to only within three hundred feet. With these limitations, the County of Santa Cruz disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy or correctness of this data.
