  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents the predicted mammal diversity, or the total number of mammal species, in Kenya.The greatest concentration of mammal species (more than 69 species) is most likely to be found in Kenya’s central and western highlands—areas that are now dominatedby cropland and human settlements. Predicted species diversity are at similarly high levels in the adjoiningrangelands (classified as bushland, woodland, savanna, or grassland), such as those located southof Nairobi, near the Tanzanian border. Numbers of mammal species are smallest in areas of lower elevationand lesser rainfall (toward the border with Ethiopia and Somalia), signaling mammals’ dependence on theavailability of water and specific climatic and habitat conditions. This data was used in Map 5.2 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being. Istituto di ecologia applicata. (1998). Mammal Diversity: Kenya, 1998. World Resources Institute. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/bf137pp5814 Original data are downloadable at http://www.gisbau.uniroma1.it/amd.php. This dataset accounts for the following diversity of mammals: Bovidae (Horned antelopes) Giraffidae (Giraffes) Hippopotamidae (Hippopotamuses) Suidae (Pigs) Tragulidae (Chevrotains) Equidae (Horses) Procavidae (Rock hyraxes) Orycteropidae (Aardvark) Canidae (Dogs and allies) Felidae (Cats) Herpestidae (Mongoose) Hyaenidae (Hyaenids) Mustelidae (Mustelids) Viverridae (Genets and civets) Erinaceidae (Hedgehogs) Tenrecidae (Otter shrews) Leporidae (Hares) Macroscelididae (Soft-furred elephant shrews) Manidae (Pangolins) Cercopithecidae (Monkeys) Galagonidae (Bushbabies) Hominidae (Man and apes) Loridae (Lorisids) Hystricidae (Porcupines) Pedetidae (Spring hares) Data set is not for use in litigation.
