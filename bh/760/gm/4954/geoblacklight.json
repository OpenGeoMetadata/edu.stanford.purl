  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents existing electrical transmission substations and those planned through 2022 for the New England coastal region. A substation is a part of an electrical generation, transmission, and distribution system. Substations transform voltage from high to low, or the reverse, or perform any of several other important functions. Between the generating station and consumer, electric power may flow through several substations at different voltage levels. This data depicts substations (facilities that switch, change, and/or regulate electric voltage) existing in the New England area (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont). These substations are all connected using segments of the New England Transmission Lines layer. Transmission lines (structures that form a path for directing the transmission of electric power), when interconnected with each other, become transmission networks, typically referred to as \"power grids\". To support coastal and ocean planning and other activities pursuant to the Energy Policy Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Rivers and Harbors Act and the Submerged Lands Act.
