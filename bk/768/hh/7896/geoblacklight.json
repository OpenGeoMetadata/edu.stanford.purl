  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts centroid locations of 1000 foot interval Creek Stations representing dynamic segmentation measures that group data according to specific conditions for the County of Santa Clara, California. They were created for the route system called creeks01_route (PolylineM shapefile and scvwd_hydro.mdb Personal Geodatabase). Dynamic segmentation, or linear referencing, is the process of computing map locations of linearly referenced data (for example, attributes stored in a table) at run time so they can be displayed on a map, queried, and analyzed using a GIS. The dynamic segmentation process enables multiple sets of attributes to be associated with any portion of a line feature without segmenting the underlying feature. The Santa Clara Valley Water District manages an integrated water resources system that includes the supply of clean, safe water, flood protection and stewardship of streams on behalf of Santa Clara County's 1.8 million residents. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Santa Clara County, California.To create 1000 foot creek stations for mapping. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data. ",
