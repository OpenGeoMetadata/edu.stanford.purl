  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts boundaries of Airport Land Use Compatibility Zones in the County of Humboldt, California for the following airports: Arcata-Eureka Airport, Dinsmore Airport, Garberville Airport, Kneeland, Murray Field Airport and Rohnerville Airport. The objectives of compatible land use planning are to encourage land uses that are generally considered to be incompatible with airports (such as residential, schools, and churches) to locate away from airports and to encourage land uses that are more compatible (such as industrial and commercial uses) to locate around airports. In addition to aircraft noise, there are other issues, such as safety and other environmental impacts to land uses around airports which need to be considered when addressing the overal issue of land use compatibility. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been actively supporting programs to minimize noise impacts. The Humboldt County Planning and Building Department is responsible for protecting the public health, safety and welfare via building permit review and inspections consistent with California model codes as well as planning and development review and approval consistent with the county's General Plan. This Department oversees the Advance Planning Division, which is responsible for the Humboldt County's Geographic Information System (GIS) that is utilized by other County Departments; many federal, state and local agencies; and the general public. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
