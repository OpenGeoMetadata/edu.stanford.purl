  <abstract displayLabel="Abstract" lang="eng">5-year American Community Survey estimates of socioeconomic variables (see below) at the state level released in 2012. The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. States and equivalent entities are the primary governmental divisions of the United States. In addition to the fifty States, the Census Bureau treats the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and each of the Island Areas (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) as the statistical equivalents of States for the purpose of data presentation.The American Community Survey (ACS) 5 Year 2008-2012 socioeconomic information is a subset of information available for download. Downloaded tables include: B08013 - Aggregate Travel Time To Work Of Workers By Sex, B08303 - Travel Time To Work, B17019 - Poverty Status In The Past 12 Months Of Families By Household Type By Tenure, B17021 - Poverty Status Of Individuals In The Past 12 Months By Living Arrangement, B19001 - Household Income In The Past 12 Months, B19013 - Median Household Income In The Past 12 Months, B19025 - Aggregate Household Income In The Past 12 Months, B19113 - Median Family Income In The Past 12 Months, B19202 - Median Nonfamily Household Income In The Past 12 Months, B23001 - Sex By Age By Employment Status For The Population 16 Years And Over, B25014 - Tenure By Occupants Per Room, B25026 - Total Population in Occupied Housing Units by Tenure by year Householder Moved into Unit, B25106 - Tenure By Housing Costs As A Percentage Of Household Income In The Past 12 Months, C24010 - Sex By Occupation For The Civilian Employed Population 16 Years And Over, B20004 - Median Earnings In the Past 12 Months (In 2009 Inflation-Adjusted Dollars) by Sex by Educational Attainment for the Population 25 Years and Over, B23006 - Educational Attainment by Employment Status for the Population 25 to 64 Years and B24021 - Occupation By Median Earnings In The Past 12 Months (In 2012 Inflation-Adjusted Dollars) For The Full-Time, Year-Round Civilian Employed Population 16 Years And Over.

  <abstract displayLabel="Purpose" lang="eng">This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)</abstract>
