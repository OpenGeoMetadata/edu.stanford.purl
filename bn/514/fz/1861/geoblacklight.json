  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents No Discharge Zones in the Northeastern United States. A No Discharge Zone (NDZ) is a designated boundary within which the discharge of treated and untreated sewage from vessels is prohibited. There are a number of harmful pollutants found in sewage discharges that negatively impact both aquatic and human health. Pump-out facilities are located within the boundaries of NDZs to facilitate the elimination of sewage from vessels, or sewage must be retained onboard for disposal beyond three miles from shore. The No Discharge Zone boundaries are based on information within the Federal Register and were produced by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Regions 1 and 2. Zone boundaries in Region 1 were also coordinated with the Massachusetts Coastal Zone Management. This dataset displays NDZs in EPA Region 1 and Region 2, which are current as of 2014 and 2011, respectively. Data from both regions were merged into one dataset and boundaries between different zone features were harmonized to eliminate boundary discrepancies. NDZs within the Hudson River, New York State Canal System, Lake Champlain, Lake George, and south of New York Harbor were not included. This dataset was updated in 2014 to include all waters under Massachusetts state jurisdiction. Three NDZs were added in Massachusetts including ferry corridors in the Vineyard Sound and Nantucket Sound and a zone extending from Manchester-By-The-Sea to Marshfield. Additionally, the Long Island Sound NDZ in New York State was updated from a proposed status to a final status. 2. PURPOSE This datasetTo support coastal and ocean planning and other activities pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act, Energy Policy Act, Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Rivers and Harbors Act and the Submerged Lands Act.",
