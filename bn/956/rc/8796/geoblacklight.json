  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents coastal marinas in California. The California Department of Boating and Waterways provided the California Department of Fish and Widllife Marine Region GIS Lab with a boating facilities GIS dataset. The GIS Lab manually selected coastal and marine related marinas from the boating facilities dataset to create this point shapefile. Only the name field was used from the boating facilities dataset and the GIS Lab added and attributed the rest of the fields in the dataset. Some additional marinas were added that were not included in the boating facilities dataset.The coverage depicts coastal and marine-related boat marinas on the California coast.",
