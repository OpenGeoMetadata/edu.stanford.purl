  "dc_description_s": "This polygon dataset contains estimates of biomass resource potential for the lower 48 states of the United States. The following feedstock categories are considered for this study: crop residues, methane emissions from manure management, methane emissions from landfills and wastewater treatment facilities, forest residues, primary and secondary mill residues, urban wood waste, and dedicated energy crops. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for renewable and electric energy in the U.S. This layer is from the 2013 Spring Quarter update (Update 1011). This shapefile can aid in estimating biomass resource availability in counties within the United States. Hart Energy Publishing (2013). Biomass Resource Potential in the United States, Spring 2013. Hart Energy Publishing. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/bp496sf3076. This release is intended to replace all previous datasets. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
