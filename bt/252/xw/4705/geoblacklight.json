  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts the vernal pool study area boundaries within Monterey, Santa Barbara, San Benito, San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties.This coverage presents findings from comprehensive mapping of vernal pool habitats in Monterey, Santa Barbara, San Benito, San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties. In 1995, Dr. Robert F. Holland identified the complexes on aerial photos (the most recent available for each county) and traced the polygons onto USGS 7.5' quads from which they were digitized. Vernal pool complexes were then given a density rating. The coverage was refined in June of 1998, with SPOT Imagery and recent U2 (low-flying aircraft) photography. The layer does not contain delineations of individual vernal pools and was not intended for use in wetland delineations. This coverage allows for display and analysis of existing vernal pool complexes in these California counties.",
