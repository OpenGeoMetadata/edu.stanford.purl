  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts the suitability layer developed for use with Marxan estimates of ecological integrity to identify areas that are best suited to conserve target species in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California. Parcelization (Upland Habitat Goals), population density (USGS), and distance to paved roads (USGS) were chosen to estimate suitability because all three contribute to habitat degradation and fragmentation. Larger, intact regions are considered to be of higher ecological integrity. These three factors were summed to create the total suitability index for every hexagonal planning unit, displaying areas of low suitability (urban, close to roads, high population density) and more suitability (larger parcels, further distance to roads, lower population density). This layer was key input into the Marxan modeling process and helps encourage the model to capture large, intact landscapes and generally stay away from fragmented and converted lands.This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
