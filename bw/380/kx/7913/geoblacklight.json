  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts fire hazard boundaries in the County of San Mateo, California. This dataset includes State Responsibility Areas (SRA) and Local Responsibility Areas (LRA) and hazard classifications. Classification of a zone as moderate, high or very high fire hazard is based on a combination of how a fire will behave and the probability of flames and embers threatening buildings. Each zone gets a score for flame length, embers, and the likelihood of the area burning. Scores are then averaged over the zone areas. Final zone class (moderate, high and very high) is based on the averaged scores for the zone. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) has a legal responsibility to provide fire protection on all State Responsibility Area (SRA) lands, which are defined based on land ownership, population density and land use SRA designations undergo a thorough 5 year review cycle. The County of San Mateo, California holds authority over the LRA, which includes incorporated cities and cultivated agriculture lands. LRA fire protection is typically provided by city fire departments, fire protection districts, counties nd by CAL FIRE under contract to local government. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for San Mateo County, California.This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
