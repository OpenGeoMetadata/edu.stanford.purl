  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts locations of geologic reports submitted withland use applications for the County of Santa Cruz, California. Engineering geology reports must be prepared by a geologist licensed by the State of California Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors and Geologists. Only reports prepared by a properly licensed professional will be accepted for review by the County. Development and development activities may be required to have a Geologic Hazards Assessment (GHA) done prior to issuance of a building permit. GHAâ€™s are generally required in areas that are potentially hazardous (geologically speaking). (Geologic Hazards Ordinance (Section 16.10.040s). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California.The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. The GIS Unit serves all County departments and external customers and provides data on land, features and people of Santa Cruz County. Santa Cruz County encompasses 4 cities and approximately 265,000 people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
