  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents the depth to groundwater below the ground surface in California during the Spring of 2013. This layer is a smoothed approximation of the groundwater level 'surface' based on the measurement data. The measurement values may not exactly match the contour values because of the contour smoothing process. Depth information is represented in feet below the ground surface. Water level measurements are selected based on measurement data and well construction information (where available) and approximate groundwater levels in the unconfined to uppermost semi-confined aquifers. This layer is intended to be used as a compliment to data, reports, and other information provided by the California Groundwater Information Center. California Department of Water Resources. (2016). Groundwater Depth Contours, California, Spring 2013. California Department of Water Resources. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/bx989gc0238. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
