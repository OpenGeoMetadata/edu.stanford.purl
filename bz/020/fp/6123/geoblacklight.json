  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains the boundaries of land plots as represented in Philibert Vasserot's Atlas of Paris (1810-1836). Vasserot's 19th century plots were aligned with 20th century plot data provided by the Paris Urban Planning Agency (APUR). When no information existed for the old plots, various archival materials and other data from the relevant time period were used.The ALPAGE programme aims to provide collaborative tools for the Humanities and Social Sciences and for Information Communication Technology (ICT) allowing for the development of research about the Parisian urban area. This aim is achieved by means of a GIS that includes cadastral and historical layers.",
