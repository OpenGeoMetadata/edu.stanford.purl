  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains the habitat boundaries of the San Joaquin Kit Fox within Monterey County, California. The San Joaquin kit fox is the smallest member of the dog family in North America. Historically, this kit fox was widely distributed throughout grassland, scrubland, and wetland communities in the San Joaquin Valley and adjacent low foothills, but agricultural, urban, and industrial development in the Valley — including oil and gas development — has led to extensive and continuing loss of native habitat, the primary threat to kit foxes. Today, much of the kit fox’s remaining habitat is extremely fragmented, movement corridors are degraded or blocked, and only a few large areas of native grasslands remain on the San Joaquin Valley’s perimeter.This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Monterey County in California.This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
