  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile shows the 1992 land use/land cover of the riparian zone of the Russian River tributaries in Mendocino County, California. The polygons were digitized from 1:6,000-scale aerial photo enlargements. This work is a result of the Upper Russian River Aggregate Resources Management Plan. Feature boundaries were interpreted from aerial photos and were registered to a digital map based on USGS 1:1000,000-scale DLGs using the projective transformation routine in AutoCAD Release 12.0. Manual digitizing was done on a 24\" x 36\" CalComp Drawing Board II digitizing tablet. ArcView 3.1 was used to convert the AutoCAD drawings to GIS coverages by creating topology and links to the attribute data. This layer can be used for land use analysis and planning in the Russian River region of California.",
