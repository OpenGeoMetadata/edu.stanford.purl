  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile depicts geologic units, such as lithologic contacts, fault contacts, and watershed boundary codings, within the Freshwater Creek watershed in Humboldt County, California at 1:24,000 scale. This map contains a digital representation of the map Geologic and Geomorphic Features Related to Landsliding, OFR 99-10, and the map of Relative Landslide Potential, OFR 99-10a. The map of Landslide Potential With Geologic and Geomorphic Features is a digital representation of the map of Geologic and Geomorphic Features Related to Landsliding, OFR 99-10, combined with the map of Relative Landslide Potential, OFR 99-10a. This map set was created using an ArcInfo GIS database by compiling information from OFR 99-10 and OFR 99-10a. The data for the original mapping (OFR 99-10 and 99-10a) was compiled from multiple sources including published maps and reports, aerial photograph mapping, and reconnaissance geologic mapping. The maps/data are useful in preparation of Timber Harvesting Plans, and for use by land managers for identifying areas of potentially unstable ground. The maps/data serve as a guide to potential problem areas where more site-specific review is required.",
