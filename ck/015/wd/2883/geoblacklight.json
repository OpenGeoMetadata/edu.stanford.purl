  "dc_description_s": "This data includes beaches open to the public that could be viewed as sections of the California Coastal Trail (CCT). The data was taken directly from Coastwalk's 2008 alignment of the CCT and has only briefly been reviewed. Section of beach may be hazardous to walk on because of tides, sneaker waves, and winter storms. This layer is part of the San Mateo County Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment Project. These data are intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.",
