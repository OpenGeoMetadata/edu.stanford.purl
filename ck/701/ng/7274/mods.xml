  <abstract displayLabel="Abstract" lang="eng">This polygon shapefile data is derived from an extract of HUD CPDs Disaster Recovery Grants Reporting (DRGR) System. Each observation in the raw DRGR extract is an address at which an Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) activity took place. If multiple activities took place at one address, that address would be in the database multiple times and would over-count NSP activity. This is likely to be the case if a grantee reports the same property under an acquisition activity and a rehab activity. Steps have been taken to mitigate the occurrences of over-counting through the standardization of addresses, the prioritization of activity types for those addresses where more than one activity took place, and then the removal of duplicate addresses. For example: if a grantee reported an acquisition and rehab activity at the same address, the rehab activity will be prioritized over the rehab and the acquisition will be removed. The data will also over-count NSP activity if grantees enter an activity at a single address in multiple quarterly performance reports; much of this double counting will also be mitigated through the standardization and duplicate removal process. Conversely, if multiple units were assisted at a single address, that address would under-represent NSP activity. This is likely to be the case if a grantee reports a single address that actually represents a group of properties or a property with multiple units. We are currently working on a process to mitigate these instances, but this will not be available until next quarter. The observations were reported by grantees through December 31, 2013. The data extract was drawn, cleaned, and aggregated to the tract level on February 15th, 2014. Data Current As Of: 11/18/2014</abstract>
  <abstract displayLabel="Purpose" lang="eng">This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)</abstract>
