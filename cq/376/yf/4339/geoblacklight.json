  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts a compilation of marine mammal haul out features used in three Marine Life Protection Act study regions: north central coast, south coast and north coast. Data have been refined through review by each of the SATs assembled for each region. Data were not aggregated or conditioned for evalution in the central coast.This dataset provides coverage for land habitat that is used as haul out sites for periods of rest, molting and as rookeries for mating and pupping by marine mammals that have front and read flippers, including seals, sea lions and walruses. This coverage has been used to evaluate marine protected areas proposals relative to marine mammal protections by the Science Advisory Teams (SAT) assembled during implementation of the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA).
