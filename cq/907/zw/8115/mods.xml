    <abstract lang="eng" displayLabel="Abstract">This polyline shapefile depicts centerlines of Streets in the County of Humboldt, California, including street names and zip codes. This coverage was derived from United States Census Bureau TIGER/Line data.</abstract>
    <abstract lang="eng" displayLabel="Purpose">The Humboldt County Planning and Building Department is responsible for protecting the public health, safety and welfare via building permit review and inspections consistent with California model codes as well as planning and development review and approval consistent with the county's General Plan. This Department oversees the Advance Planning Division, which is responsible for the Humboldt County's Geographic Information System (GIS) that is utilized by other County Departments; many federal, state and local agencies; and the general public. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.</abstract>

    <note displayLabel="Supplemental information">Updates/History/Corrections: Numerous updates and corrections made to linework using scanned and rectified USGS 7.5' Quads (1995-1998). Attribute updating and checks were done using multiple sources. Most recent update (April 2001) used USGS 3.75' Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads to correct linework for selected roads. For some areas, linework was corrected based on feedback from Local Fire Departments. Linework was corrected to match USGS DOQQ's - 2004 &amp; 2005.

[Altname] was added as an attribute which contains corrected road names based
of feedback from Fire Departments. Attribute updates were done 4-15-02. Functional classification (funclass) was updated using Caltrans Func roadway dataset. Other attributes from the Func dataset were also added and populated.</note>
    <note displayLabel="Use limitation">The County of Humboldt makes no guarantee of the quality or completeness of this data. It has not been fully reviewed for accuracy and is intended to be used for planning purposes only. The department assumes no liability or responsibility in the use of this data. While every effort has been made to assure the accuracy of this information, it should be understood that it does not have the force and effect of law, rule, or regulation. In the event of any difference or error, the law will take precedence. The accuracy of map data varies from location to location in the county. While the GIS is useful for planning purposes, it should not be relied upon to determine property, zoning or general plan designation boundaries or be used in any way for project design. All GIS data should be verified before it is materially relied upon for property or project planning. In urban areas the GIS map data maybe inaccurate by as much as 50 feet in any direction. In rural areas the map data may be inaccurate by as much as 400 feet in any direction.</note>
