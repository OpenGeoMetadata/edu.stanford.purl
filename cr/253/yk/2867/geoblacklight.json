  "dc_description_s": "This layer represents a merged shapefile of all polyline features originally created for the Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve Habitat Assessment for 1997-1998. Polyline features within this file include stream centerlines, contours, fence lines and trails. This shapefile provides a comprehensive strategy for targeting open space protection efforts in the highest priority areas. State law requires that each county and city prepare an Open Space Element as part of its General Plan that addresses how preservation of open space lands will be implemented. The 1989 Sonoma County General Plan implements legal requirements for preservation of open space land through various plan elements, including Open Space, Resource Conservation, Land Use, Public Safety, and Agricultural Resources.
