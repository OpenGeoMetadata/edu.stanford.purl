    <abstract lang="eng" displayLabel="Abstract">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided a second round of funds in 2009. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) provides grants to states, local governments, nonprofits and a consortium of nonprofit entities on a competitive basis. The Recovery Act also authorized HUD to establish NSP-TA (Technical Assistance), a $50 million allocation made available to national and local technical assistance providers to support NSP grantees. NSP2 grantees are constrained to Census Tract boundaries. The U.S. Congress has appropriated three rounds of NSP funding: NSP1. Under this first round of NSP funding, NSP1 provided $3.92 billion to 307 state and local governments on a formula basis. NSP1 was established by Section 2301(b) of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (Pub. L.110–289, approved July 30, 2008), also known as HERA. HERA created NSP and is the basis for subsequent NSP funding rounds. NSP2. Under this second round of NSP funding, NSP2 was authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, (Pub. L. 111–5, approved February 17, 2009), also referred to as ARRA or “the Recovery Act.” $1.93 billion in NSP2 funds were made available on a competitive basis to 56 states, local governments, nonprofits, and consortia of nonprofit entities. The Recovery Act also authorized HUD to establish NSP-TA, a $50 million allocation made available to national and local technical assistance providers to support NSP grantees. NSP3. Under this third round of NSP funding, an additional $1 billion was made available on a formula basis to 270 state and local governments. NSP3 was authorized by Section 1497 of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111–203, approved July 21, 2010), also known as the “Dodd-Frank Act.” Data Current As Of: 12/3/2014</abstract>
    <abstract lang="eng" displayLabel="Purpose">This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)</abstract>
