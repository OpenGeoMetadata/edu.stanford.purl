  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced image of a map of Japan created in 1694. The original map is a hand-colored woodblock print showing places of interest pictorially. Includes lists of shrines, 2 seasonal diagrs., and distance charts and legend. Shows daimyo domains. Covers Matsumae to Tsushima and Ryukyu. This historical cartographic image is part of the Japanese Map Collection of the UC Berkeley East Asian Library. The historic map layers in the Google Earth Rumsey Map Collection have been selected by David Rumsey from his large collection of historical maps, as well as some from other collections with which he collaborates. All the maps contain rich information about the past and represent a sampling of time periods, scales, and cartographic art, resulting in visual history stories that only old maps can tell. Each map has been georeferenced by Rumsey, thus creating unique digital map images that allow the old maps to appear in their correct places on the modern globe.  Some of the maps fit perfectly in their modern spaces, while othersgenerally earlier period mapsreveal interesting geographical misconceptions of their time.  Cultural features on the maps can be compared to the modern satellite views using the slider bars to adjust transparency. The result is an exploration of time as well as space, a marriage of historic cartographic masterpieces with innovative contemporary software tools.",
