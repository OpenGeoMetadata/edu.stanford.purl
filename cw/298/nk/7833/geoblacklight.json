  "dc_description_s": "The 2000 Medical Service Study Area (MSSA) Census Tract Detail polygon layer represents all California census tract boundaries used in the construction of the 2000 MSSA Boundaries. Each of the state's 7,049 census tracts was assigned to a medical service study area, as identified in this data layer. The 2000 MSSA Census Tract Detail data is aggregated by OSHPD, to create the 2000 MSSA data layer. This layer is part of the Healthcare Atlas of California. The 2000 MSSA Census Tract Detail map layer was developed to support geographic information systems (GIS) applications, representing 2000 census tract geography that is the foundation of 2000 medical service study area (MSSA) boundaries.
