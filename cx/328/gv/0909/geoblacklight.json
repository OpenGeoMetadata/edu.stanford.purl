  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents households with unsatisified basic needs in living space according to the 2011 Census of Uruguay. These are critical deficiencies in the physical space available for each member of the household within the dwelling. A home is considered overcrowded if the number of people in the household compared to the total number of rooms in the house exceeds two (excluding the bathroom and the kitchen). An index of unsatisfied basic needs (Necesidadas Basicas Insatisfechas) is used to measure poverty. NBI includes indicators such as access to clean water, quality of housing, crowding, education level and others. The census information was collected by the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica in Uruguay between September 1 and December 31 of 2011. The original questionnaire and other supporting documentation for this census is included with this download. These data are intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.",
