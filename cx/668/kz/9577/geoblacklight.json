  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains the locations of local government agency owned bridges in the California state highway system as of April 2015. Bridge inventory data was obtained from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Structure Maintenance and Investigations (SMI) Database. SMI performs bridge inspections in accordance with federal regulations on over 12,000 State Highway bridges and approximately 12,200 bridges owned by local government agencies. Caltrans bridge inspectors are responsible for maintaining the safety and integrity of over 24000 bridges owned by the State of California and California's local government agencies. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
