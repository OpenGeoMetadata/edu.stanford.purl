  "dc_description_s": "The Satellite View of Alaska, with Shaded Relief map layer is a 200-meter-resolution simulated-natural-color image of Alaska. Vegetation is generally green, with darker greens representing forest and lighter greens representing vegetative tundra. Vegetative tundra regions are composed of shallow rooted plants. Very bright areas, such as snow and ice, are colored blue. The image was produced by combining Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery from the Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 satellites with relief enhanced by shading. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States. The Satellite View with Shaded Relief image was developed to portray the terrain and land cover of Alaska. The image is intended for visual purposes only. The original Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and National Elevation Dataset (NED) data must be used for conducting analysis. National Atlas of the United States. (2006). Satellite View of Alaska, with Shaded Relief. National Atlas of the United States. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/cy068bm1264. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
