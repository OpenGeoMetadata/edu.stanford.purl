  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile shows the locations of large hydropower dams in Kenya. Dams were located based on existing data from the Geological Survey of Kenya (1971) and KenGen (2006). Hydropower dams, although contributing signiﬁcantly to economic development and human well-being, can have negative impacts on populations and ecosystems as well. Dams can affect downstream water supply, displace people, ruin aesthetic and sometimes spiritual landmarks such as waterfalls, and increase threats to ﬁsh and other species that depend on rivers for their habitat.This data was used in Map 3.11 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being.",
