  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents geologic strikes and dips of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve (JRBP), in Woodside, California. These data were digitized from the Geologic Map of the Jasper Ridge Area, compiled by R.G. Coleman (1997). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created and managed by the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
