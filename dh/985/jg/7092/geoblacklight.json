  "dc_description_s": "The Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program funds are distributed to states and cities by formula allocations and made available as part of the area's Consolidated Plan. Persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families may require housing that provides emergency, transitional, or long-term affordable solutions. In addition, some projects are selected in national competitions to serve as service delivery models or operate in non-formula areas. Grantees partner with nonprofit organizations and housing agencies to provide housing and support to beneficiaries. Data Current As Of: FY2016This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)",
