  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains the locations of hospital heliports in California as of 2015. Each location is supplied along with the links to the heliport info sheets that provide permitted approach paths and other information for all the permitted Hospital Heliports in California. The information will be helpful to emergency planners, helicopter operators, and other users. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. California Department of Transportation. (2015). Hospital Heliports, California, 2015. California Department of Transportation. Available at http://purl.stanford.edu/dj057mw1855. Original data is based on hospital heliport permit safety inspections but coordinates have been modified using Google Earth/Maps aerial imagery background for Caltrans Earth applications.\n\nAdditional information and heliport interactive map site can be found at the Caltrans Division of Aeronautics home page:  http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/planning/aeronaut/index.html\nhttp://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/planning/aeronaut/dataplates.html\n\nMore information can be found at Caltrans division of Aeronautics website at http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/planning/aeronaut/index.htm,or visit Hospital Heliport Dataplates website at http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/planning/aeronaut/helipads/dataplates/ This data is provided as a service for planning purposes and not intended for design, navigation purposes or airspace consideration. Such needs should include discussions with the Federal Aviation Administration, Caltrans Division of Aeronautics, and the site management/owners.",
