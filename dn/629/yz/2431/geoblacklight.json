  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile was created by digitizing locations of stream habitat restoration projects marked on maps included in the paper documentation of the projects. Approximately 12% of projects sites (455/3850) could not be placed at specific locations. Data includes habitat improvement projects, research projects (surveys and studies of streams, roads, watersheds), education projects, and hatchery projects (including trapping, spawning, rearing and releasing salmonids) and contains all completed projects (for which final reports have been received) funded through the California Department of Fish and Game's Fisheries Restoration Grants Program (FRGP).This shapefile is intended to be a comprehensive repository for anadromous stream restoration projects throughout California. Line features describe the geographic areas where restoration projects were completed through the California Department of Fish and Game's Fisheries Restoration Grants Program (FRGP).",
