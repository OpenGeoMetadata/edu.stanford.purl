  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile was created by digitizing locations of stream habitat restoration projects marked on maps included in the paper documentation of the projects. Approximately 12% of projects sites (455/3850) could not be placed at specific locations. Data includes habitat improvement projects, research projects (surveys and studies of streams, roads, watersheds), education projects, and hatchery projects (including trapping, spawning, rearing and releasing salmonids) and contains all completed projects (for which final reports have been received) funded through the California Department of Fish and Game's Fisheries Restoration Grants Program (FRGP). This shapefile is intended to be a comprehensive repository for anadromous stream restoration projects throughout California. Line features describe the geographic areas where restoration projects were completed through the California Department of Fish and Game's Fisheries Restoration Grants Program (FRGP). Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). Anadromous Stream Restoration Projects (Lines): Russian River, California, 1981-2002. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/dn629yz2431 This shapefile must be used in conjunction with rr_restoration_pts1.shp (points) and rr_restoration_plys3.shp (polygons) in order to view the complete set of project locations for the Russian River basin portion of the CHRPD.\n\nLine locations were originally digitized using two different methods. Instream locations were digitized by referencing them directly to the place along the stream in which the work was done. This was accomplished using NCNCR Hydrography Tools and routed 1:100K California hydrography (for questions about the tools and hydrography, contact Eric Haney, Information Services Branch Manager,\nNorthern California North Coast Region Dept. of Fish and Game, (530) 225-2052, ehaney@dfg.ca.gov). Locations that were not along streams were heads-up digitized. These two different shapefiles were merged into a single line shapefile for the purposes of this data release. \n\nSee CHRPD documentation for a detailed description of data categories in the database and the data entry process. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
