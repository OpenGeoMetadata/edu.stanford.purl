  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents time zone boundaries for the world. Time zones are primarily derived from the Central Intelligence Agency map of Time Zones (2012). Boundaries were adjusted to fit the Natural Earth line work at a scale of 1:10 million and to follow twelve nautical mile territorial sea boundary lines when running along coasts. Additional research was performed based on recent news to update several areas including the international dateline and time zone adjustments for Samoa and Tokelau and the discarding of daylight savings time in Russia. These data are represented at 1:10,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0).Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software.",
