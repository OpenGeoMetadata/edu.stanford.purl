  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile shows the rivers and tributaries of the Godavari Watershed in India for 2012. Rivers &amp; tributaries data is compiled from high-resolution (1m) imagery. This layer is part of the Watershed Map of India which includes information about drainage networks (i.e. major rivers, streams and large reservoirs.) Also includes data on catchment areas/watersheds boundaries, basins and sub-basins.These data are intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.",
