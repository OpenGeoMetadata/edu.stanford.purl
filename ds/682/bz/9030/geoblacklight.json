  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts Williamson Act Parcels with a contract that has been non-renewed within the unincorporated areas of the County of Santa Clara, California. According to the California Department of Conservation, either the local government or landowner can initiate the nonrenewal process. A \"notice of nonrenewal\" starts the 9-year nonrenewal period. During the nonrenewal process, the annual tax assessment continually increases each year until it is equivalent to current tax rates at the end of the nonrenewal period. The contract is then terminated. The California Land Conservation Act, better known as the Williamson Act, has been the Californiaâ€™s agricultural land protection program since its enactment in1965. The Williamson Act preserves agricultural and open space lands through property tax incentives and voluntary restrictive use contracts. Contracts renew automatically every year unless the non-renewal process is initiated. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Santa Clara County, California.The Santa Clara County Planning Office is part of the Department of Planning and Development. Their primary function is to plan and regulate land use and development within the unincorporated portions of Santa Clara County. Other responsibilities include policy analysis, GIS services, research and technical assistance relating to land use, housing, environmental protection, historic preservation and demographics. The Geographic Information Services Department has taken on all those activities related to GIS data and GIS process and procedures that cross organizational boundaries.

This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data. ",
