To meet the requirements of Chapter 8, Article 3 (commencing with Section 4531), California Public Resources Code, and to designate areas for appropriate special forest practice rules, the nonfederally-owned commercial forest areas of the state are divided into three districts which are designated as Coast Forest District, Northern Forest District, and Southern Forest District. Each district is comprised of timberlands and cutover lands within the boundaries as set forth in this article. The Coast Forest District is further sub-divided into the Southern SubDistrict.",
