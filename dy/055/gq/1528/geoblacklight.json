  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts parcels that are eligible to use the Zayante Sandhills Conservation Bank as mitigation for loss of sandhills habitat in conjunction with proposed development in the County of Santa Cruz, California. It will be used by County staff for notifying the public whether or not they are eligible to use the Bank as mitigation for their proposed development project. The Interim Programmatic Habitat Conservation Plan (IPHCP) addresses the incidental take of endangered species associated with residential projects located in already developed neighborhoods within the Sandhills. The plan will describe the specific eligibility criteria for projects and identify the neighborhoods in which landowners can utilize the IPHCP. Originally drafted in 2002, completion of the IPHCP was delayed due to the absence of a feasible method for landowners to mitigate the impacts of their projects on endangered species by providing for preservation of habitat. In June 2005, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service revised the plan to identify mitigation options, which include purchasing credits in the Zayante Sandhills Conservation Bank and providing the revised plan to the County of Santa Cruz for final review. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California.The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. The GIS Unit serves all County departments and external customers and provides data on land, features and people of Santa Cruz County. Santa Cruz County encompasses 4 cities and approximately 265,000 people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
