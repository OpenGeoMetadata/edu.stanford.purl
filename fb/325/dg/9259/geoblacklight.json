  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains mental health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) in California. The federal HPSA designation (formerly Health Manpower Shortage Areas) identifies areas as having a shortage of mental health providers on the basis of availability of psychiatrist and mental health professionals. To qualify for designation as a Mental HPSA, an area must be: 1. A rational service area for the delivery of mental health services, 2. A lack of access to care provided by Core Mental Health Professionals (CMHP) in the area, and 3. One of the following conditions prevails in the area: a. The population to CMHP ratio is &gt; 6,000:1, and the population to psychiatrist ratio is &gt; 20,000:1, OR b. The population to CMHP ratio is &gt; 9,000:1 OR c. The population to psychiatrist ratio is &gt; 30,000:1. Benefits of designation as a HPSA include: student loan repayment and personnel placement through the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) improved Medicare reimbursement enhanced federal grant eligibility.
