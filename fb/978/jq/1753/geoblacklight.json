  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile shows the watershed boundaries of the Russian River Basin. These data are derived from the California Watershed Map (v.2.2), a set of standardized watershed boundaries meeting standardized delineation criteria. The calw22a watersheds were selected based on their attribute values from the HUNAME field which indicates the Hydologic Unit Name of each watershed. This shapefile provides the basis for mapping, reporting, and statistical analysis of water resources, water supply, water quality, wildlands, agriculture, soils, forests, rangelands, fish habitat, wildlife habitat, cross-referencing state and federal hydrologic unit or watershed codes and names. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). Watershed Map: Russian River, California, 1999. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/fb978jq1753 The hierarchy of watershed designations consists of six levels of increasing specificity: Hydrologic Region (HR), Hydrologic Unit (HU), Hydrologic Area (HA), Hydrologic Sub-Area (HSA), Super Planning Watershed (SPWS), and Planning Watershed (PWS). The primary purpose of Calwater is the assignment of a single, unique code to a specific watershed polygon. While there are 7022 polygons in the ARC/INFO coverage, there are actually fewer watershed codes. This is due to cases of multiple polygons bearing the same watershed code (Channel Islands, split polygons due to other boundary integration, e.g. ground water basins). Another confusing factor is that not all Hydrologic Units are subdivided into Hydrologic Areas, not all Hydrologic Areas are subdivided into Hydrologic Sub-Areas, and so on.
