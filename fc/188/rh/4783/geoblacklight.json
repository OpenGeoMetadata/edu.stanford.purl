  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents boat launches in the San Mateo County Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment Project area. The California Department of Boating and Waterways provided the California Department of Fish and Game Marine Region GIS Lab with a boating facilities GIS dataset. The GIS Lab manually selected coastal and marine related boat launch sites from the boating facilities dataset to create this dataset. Only the name field was used from the boating facilities dataset and the GIS Lab added and attributed the rest of the fields in the dataset. Positions were more accurately located with the aid of aerial imagery. This layer is part of the San Mateo County Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment Project. These data are intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.",
