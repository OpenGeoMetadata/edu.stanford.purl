  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts locations of minor discharges into Southern California's near-coastal marine waters, but does not include discharges into enclosed bays and estuaries. The category 'Minor' used to describe this feature was derived from the Marine Life Protection Act South Coast Study Region Scientific Advisory Team conclusion that any facility that had a design flow rate less than 1 million gallons-per-day (MGD) would get a 'Minor' discharge rating. Small aquaculture facilities, desalination plants, and marine labs that discharge more than 1 MGD were included in the minor category. This coverage displays locations of and information about minor ocean wastewater discharges alongthe Southern California Bight, the curved coastline of Southern California between Point Conception and San Diego. California Department of Fish and Wildlife Marine Resources Region. (2008). Minor Discharges into Near-Coastal Marine Waters: Southern California, 2008. California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Marine Resources Region. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/fh182cj0385. Data was collected from a variety of sources, including SWRCB Division of Water Quality NPDES permit files and spreadsheets, the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project's Final Report: Discharges into State Water Quality Protection Areas (2003) and associated GIS data, the San Francisco Estuary Institute/SWRCB Water Quality Monitoring Inventory Website, and limited staff field observations. (http://www.sfei.org/camp/servlet/ListPgms?which=byOrg ). In December 2008 a location for Terminal Island Treatment plant was added to this feature class at the request of Brian Owens (DFG). In February 2009 these points were all designated \"Minor\" by Brian Owens (DFG). If a reason can be given for this minor designation it will be in the reason_adj column of the attribute table.
