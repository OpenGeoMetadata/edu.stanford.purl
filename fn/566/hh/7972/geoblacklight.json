  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of an historic regional map of Egypt, titled 'A New Map of Egypt,' originally created by John Cary in 1805. This map contains an inset: The Delta and Adjacent Parts upon an Enlarged Scale. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map was georeferenced by the Stanford University Geospatial Center using a Transverse Mercator projection. This map is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Africa from the Oscar I. Norwich Collection at Stanford University.This historic paper map provides an historical perspective of the cultural and physical landscape during this time period. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography. As this map has been georeferenced, it also can be used as a background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.\n    ",
