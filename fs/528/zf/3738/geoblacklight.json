  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents the 2000 U.S. Census secondary school district boundaries in South Carolina. Secondary school districts provide education to the upper grade/age levels and the elementary school districts provide education to the lower grade/age levels. The unified school districts are districts that provide education to children of all school ages. In general, where there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists and where there is an elementary school district, the secondary school district may or may not exist. School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for school districts in the 1970 census. For Census 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data for three types of school districts: elementary, secondary, and unified. Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. U.S. Census Bureau. Geography Division. (2001). Secondary School Districts, South Carolina, 2000. U.S. Census Bureau. Geography Division. Available at http://purl.stanford.edu/fs528zf3738. The Census Bureau’s representation of school districts is based on the grade ranges for which the school district is financially responsible, which may or may not be the grade ranges that a school district operates. (The grade range that reflects financial responsibility is important for the allocation of Title I funds.) A typical example would be a school district that operates schools for children in grades Kindergarten (KG)-8 and pays for a neighboring school district to educate children in grades 9–12. The first school district is operationally responsible for grades K-8, but financially responsible for grades KG- 12. Therefore, the Census Bureau would define the grade range for that school district as KG-12. If an elementary school district is financially responsible for grades KG-12 or Pre-Kindergarten (PK)–12, there will be no secondary school district represented for that area. In cases, where an elementary school district is financially responsible for only lower grades, there is generally a secondary school district that is financially responsible for providing educational services for the upper grades.
