The ALPAGE programme aims to provide collaborative tools for the Humanities and Social Sciences and for Information Communication Technology (ICT) allowing for the development of research about the Parisian urban area. This aim is achieved by means of a GIS that includes cadastral and historical layers. Arch. nat. F31 73-96 – Arch. Paris © ALPAGE. A. Bethe, 2010.
