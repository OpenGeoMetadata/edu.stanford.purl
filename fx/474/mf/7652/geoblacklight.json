  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts internal, first-order administrative boundaries and polygons for all but a few tiny countries. Includes name attributes (including diacritical marks), name variants, and some statistical codes (FIPS, ISO, HASC). For names that are uncertain, they are flagged as an attribute. Boundaries should perfectly match the following Natural Earth Vector themes: coastline, lake shoreline, admin-0 country boundary, river and lake centerlines. The GeoDB format preserves local scripts better than SHP format. These data are represented at 1:10,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0). Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software. Kelso, N.V. and Patterson, T. (2012). State and Province Boundaries, 1:10 million (2012). Made with Natural Earth, online at http://www.naturalearthdata.com.",
