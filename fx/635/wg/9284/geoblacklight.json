  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains the region boundaries for the Republic of Georgia. These are the level 1 administrative divisions (ADM1). In Georgia, a region is not a self-governing unit; its function is to coordinate communication of several municipalities (with the exception of the municipalities of Adjara and that of Tbilisi) with the central government of Georgia, which is represented in a region by an official appointed by Prime Minister, the State Commissioner. This layer is part of a collection of data relating to administrative units in the Republic of Georgia.This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
