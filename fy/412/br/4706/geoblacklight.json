This layer is part of a collection of GIS data relating to Zambia including boundary files, rivers, roads, schools, utilities, protected areas and vegetation. This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.
