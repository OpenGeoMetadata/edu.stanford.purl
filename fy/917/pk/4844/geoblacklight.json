  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents the location of boundary markers used to enforce building and expansion limits around Paris, France in the 17th and 18th centuries. During this period, French royal powers sought to control the expansion of Paris by establishing boundaries in 1638, 1672-1674, and 1724-1729, beyond which it was forbidden to build under penalty of fines. Each time, these limits were enforced by boundary markers between which the boundary remained virtual. The 1672-1674 limits significantly expanded the building sector as compared to the 1638 boundaries. The legislation of 1724-1729, too difficult to enforce, was abandoned in 1765 for the whole of the Parisian suburbs. The ALPAGE programme aims to provide collaborative tools for the Humanities and Social Sciences and for Information Communication Technology (ICT) allowing for the development of research about the Parisian urban area. This aim is achieved by means of a GIS that includes cadastral and historical layers. APUR Â© ALPAGE: Prodhomme, Marie, 2013. ISO 19139 XML Metadata (in French) and a full copy of the license (ODBL) are included with this layer. This data is a direct result of the work of the researchers from the ALPAGE consortium who released this data under an Open Data Commons Open Database Licence (ODbL). Therefore, use of this data by others must respect the legal requirements specific to this licence. All freely downloadable data contains the shapefiles, metadata file and licence files describing the users rights and responsibilities. All data produced within the consortium is published in this way with the exception of any ongoing work which is in process of academic evaluation (masters, doctoral thesis, habilitation to supervise research).
