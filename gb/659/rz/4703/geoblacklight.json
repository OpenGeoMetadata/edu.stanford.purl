The source data of vector layers were a Digital Map 1:25000 and Orthophoto, map image made in 1985 and orthophoto made in 2008. The data source of Elevation layer was developed using orthophoto 2000 year. The data source of Land Use and Vegetation layer were developed using orthophoto 2012 year. IRS, SPOT and RapidEye satellite images, dual coverage, orthophotos (2012), topographic maps for making Land Cover.Global Map data were developed under the cooperation of National Geospatial Information Authorities (NGIAs) of respective countries and regions.",
