  <abstract displayLabel="Abstract" lang="eng">This point shapefile contains the locations of Automated Weather Observation Systems (AWOS), created from the California Aviation System Plan (2013) list. The upgrades and distribution of AWOS, Automated Surface Observation Systems (ASOS), and Automated Terminal Information Services (ATIS) in California are a critical part of the State aviation system. Access to localized weather conditions benefit both commercial and General Aviation (GA) operations. Caltrans Division of Aeronautics (Division) is monitoring the expansion and updating of the system with a focus on bringing more of this technology to key airports thereby improving air safety. Also, as AWOS/ASOS technology improves, the use of the hardware for shared uses, such as monitoring remote highways concurrently with remote airports is seen as an essential safety measure for normal as well as emergency response operations. The State is currently researching a cooperative approach to improving the road and aviation automated weather reporting system to support multimodal safety statewide. The expansion of the system through Public Private Partnerships (P3) is also becoming a topic of increasing interest as data and cost sharing strategies among various users becomes more desired, available and practical. AWOS is a computer-generated voice which is used to automate the broadcast of the minute-by-minute weather observations. ASOS is the primary surface weather observing system of the United States. ATIS is the continuous broadcast of recorded non-control information which converts selected meteorological data and air traffic control data into human speech. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).</abstract>
