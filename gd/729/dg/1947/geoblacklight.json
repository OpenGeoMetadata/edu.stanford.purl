The ferries shown in this map layer can be considered additions to or extensions of the major roads system of the United States. The transportation routes these ferries continue are identified. Train ferries are not included.The file was produced by extracting ferries from the 1:1,000,000-scale Major Roads of the United States. This is a revised version of the July 2012 map layer. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.
