  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts boundaries of the Mill Creek Wetlands in the County of Humboldt, California. The McKinleyville Community Plan adopted in December 2002 designated the Mill Creek Wetlands as a floodplain and part of the McKinleyville Planning Area for land use planning, riparian habitat management and flood control purposes. These data were derived from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife mapping of wetland areas as it appeared in the Report for Wetlands in McKinleyville as Revealed by Infrared Aerial Photograph Interpretation (Winzler &amp; Kelly, Feb., 1993), and was described in Hydrology and Ecology in the Mill Creek Corridor, McKinleyville, CA (Oscar Larson &amp; Assoc., Mar., 1995).The Humboldt County Planning and Building Department is responsible for protecting the public health, safety and welfare via building permit review and inspections consistent with California model codes as well as planning and development review and approval consistent with the county's General Plan. This Department oversees the Advance Planning Division, which is responsible for the Humboldt County's Geographic Information System (GIS) that is utilized by other County Departments; many federal, state and local agencies; and the general public. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
