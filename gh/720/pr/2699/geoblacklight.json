  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced image of a map of Shanghai that was published in 1919. It is drawn from a Russian city guide: G.G. Siunnerberg, Putevoditel' po Shanxaiu - The Guide to Shanghai, Shanghai, Russkoe knigoizdatel'stvo i tipografia komiteta obshchestvennoi pomoshchi v Shanxae, 1919. The map actually does not reflect the actual extension of the foreign settlements in 1919. In particular, the French Concession is shown (colored section) under its pre-1914 extension. The map is centered on the central districts of the two settlements.Virtual Shanghai is a research and resource platform on the history of Shanghai from the mid-nineteenth century to nowadays. It incorporates various sets of documents: essays, original documents, photographs, maps, quantitative data, etc. The objective of the project is to write a history of the city through the combined mobilization of these various types of documents. The implementation of this approach relies on the use of digital and GIS technologies. On the research side, the platform offers various ways to step into the history of the city and follow its course at different levels over time. On the resource side, apart from providing original textual and visual documents, it develops a powerful cartographic tool for spatial analysis and real-time mapping. The authors of the present project subscribe to the idea of sharing scholarship and research tools for the benefit of scholars, students, and citizens at large.",
