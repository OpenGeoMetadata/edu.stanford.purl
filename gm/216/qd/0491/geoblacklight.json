  "dc_description_s": "The Satellite View of Hawaii map layer is a 100-meter resolution simulated natural-color image of Hawaii. Vegetation is generally green, with forests in darker green and grasslands or shrublands in lighter green. Areas of high reflectance, including urban areas, rock, and dry bare soil, are shown in shades of tan and pink. Very bright areas, such as snow and ice, are light blue. The image was produced by mosaicking Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery from the Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 satellites. Bands 7 (mid-infrared), 4 (near-infrared) and 2 (green), were assigned to red, green, and blue, respectively, and adjusted to produce the final simulated natural-color image. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition National Atlas of the United States. The 100-meter resolution satellite view data were developed to portray the ground cover of the United States at 1:1,000,000 scale. The image is intended for visual purposes only. The original Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery data should be used for conducting analysis. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data. National Atlas of the United States. (2013). 100-Meter Resolution Satellite View of Hawaii. National Atlas of the United States. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/gm216qd0491. Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 satellites carry sensors that detect reflected or emitted energy from the Earth in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The sensors operate in seven spectral bands. An overview of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor, and links to more detailed information on Landsat can be found at <https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/TM>. More information on the Landsat program can be found in the USGS Fact Sheet, Landsat: A Global Land-Imaging Mission, <http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2012/3072/>. The United States of America Digital Landsat Mosaics of Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, distributed as a 4-compact-disc set, were the basis for creating the Satellite View of Hawaii. Earth Satellite Corporation, under contract to NASA and the USGS, processed the source data. USGS and NASA distribute the source data for unrestricted non-commercial use. Included with the GeoTIFF are an information file (.xml), an auxiliary information file (.aux.xml), an image overview file (.ovr), a .tfw file (more information included below), and a .prj file (more information included below.) The contents of the associated world file (.tfw) are: >100.0 >0.0 >0.0 >-100.0 >-402950.0 >2164950.0 The projection (.prj) file contains the following information: > PROJCS[\"Albers_NAD83_ Hawaii \", >GEOGCS[\"GCS_North_American_1983\", >DATUM[\"D_North_American_1983\", >SPHEROID[\"GRS_1980\",6378137.0,298.257222101]], >PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0.0], >UNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]], >PROJECTION[\"Albers\"], >PARAMETER[\"False_Easting\",0.0], >PARAMETER[\"False_Northing\",0.0], >PARAMETER[\"Central_Meridian\",-157.0], >PARAMETER[\"Standard_Parallel_1\",8.0], >PARAMETER[\"Standard_Parallel_2\",18.0], >PARAMETER[\"Latitude_Of_Origin\",3.0], >UNIT[\"Meter\",1.0]] Data set extent in meters (Albers Equal-Area Conic projection) >North 2165000 >West -403000 >East 303000 >South 1723000 There are no NULL or NODATA values in the GeoTIFF. Instead, all elevation values in oceans have been set to zero as part of the masking process.
