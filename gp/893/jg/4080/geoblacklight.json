  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents Bear Creek in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve (JRBP). Bear Creek, or Bear Gulch Creek, is a 6.6-mile-long (10.6 km) southeastward-flowing stream originating in the Santa Cruz Mountains, in San Mateo County, California. It flows through the town of Woodside. Bear Creek and Corte Madera Creek join to become San Francisquito Creek at Jasper Ridge. These data were digitized from aerial photographs. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the JRBP. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
