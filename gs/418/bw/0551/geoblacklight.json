  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents parcels over which the County of Santa Cruz, California holds authority. Assessor's parcels are based upon the legal property descriptions and are maintained by the Assessor's GIS Staff. Each Parcel is identified by an Assessor's Parcel Number (APN), which is an 8 digit number separated by dashes (e.g. 049-103-12). The first 3 digits represent the Assessor's mapbook containing the Parcel (Book 049 in the above example). The next 2 digits represent the page number within that mapbook (Page 10 in the example). The next digit represents the block number on that page (Block 3 in the example). The last 2 digits represent the Assessor's Parcel Number on that block (12 in the example). A parcel is a piece of real property under a defined ownership, or it can be a lot in a subdivision. County governments administer and legislate through the creation of and maintenance of land records that are associated with a parcel of land. Thus the parcel is often the vital administrative unit of local government. parcel maps must meet the requirements of the General Plan and all applicable laws and ordinances. Parcel maps are alternately called tax maps, plat maps, plot maps and assessor maps. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California.
