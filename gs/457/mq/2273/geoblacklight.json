  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains records of historical seismicity (1931-2001) recorded by the Northern California Earthquake Data Center. These data show clustered earthquakes along many of the faults in Monterey County. The largest concentration of events is along the San Andreas fault. Other faults with clustered seismicity include the San Gregorio fault zone (Rocky Creek segment), the Reliz fault, and the Nacimeinto fault. This layer is part of a collection describing Geology resources and constraints Monterey County, California. Epicenters occurring from 1931 to April 2001 with magnitudes of 3 or greater are plotted to provide a perspective on the historical seismicity of Monterey County. Rosenberg, Lewis, I. (2001). Earthquake Epicenters of Monterey County, California, 1931-2001. Monterey County (Calif.) Planning Department. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/gs457mq2273. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
