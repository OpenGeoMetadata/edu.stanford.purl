  "dc_description_s": "The point shapefile depicts intermodal terminal facilities where freight can be transferred between modes of transportation. The associated public database consists of four tables. One of the tables as a spatial table: Facility. The three other tables consist of attribute data for the database: Commodity, Directionality and Shipment. This database was based on the requirements from the Commodity Flow Survey and with the different modes of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), supervised by the DOT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The database will extend its design to support all of the modes within the DOT and in reference to modes involved with Intermodal transfer. This layer is part of the 2014 National Transportation Atlas Database.The National Transportation Atlas Databases 2014 (NTAD2014) is a set of nationwide geographic datasets of transportation facilities, transportation networks, associated infrastructure, and other political and administrative entities. These datasets include spatial information for transportation modal networks and intermodal terminals, as well as the reÂ¬lated attribute information for these features. This data supports research, analysis, and decision-making across all transportation modes. It is most useful at the national level, but has major applications at regional, state and local scales throughout the transportation community. The data used to compile NTAD2014 was provided by our partners within the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and by other agencies throughout the United States Federal Government. These contributors are the actual data stewards and are ultimately responsible for the maintenance and accuracy of their data.",
