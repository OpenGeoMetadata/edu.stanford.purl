      <abstract>
        <gco:CharacterString>This line shapefile represents the maritime limits of California. NOAA's Office of Coast Survey (OCS) is responsible for generating the 3 Nautical Mile Line, Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Traditionally, these maritime limits have been generated by hand from the low water line depicted on paper and United States nautical charts. Upon final approval by the United States Baseline Committee, these legally-binding maritime limits are applied to the next edition of nautical charts produced by the Marine Chart Division of OCS. Due to new cartographic production processes and the availability of digital products such as Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs), OCS has developed improved techniques for generating more accurate, digital maritime limits.</gco:CharacterString>
      </abstract>
      <purpose>
        <gco:CharacterString>This coverage can be used as a source for depiction of maritime limits on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) paper nautical charts and electronic navigational charts. The maritime limits were constructed from baseline points that represent the most seaward, drying features at mean lower low water on NOAA's largest scale, latest edition, paper nautical charts of the area. These digital boundaries do NOT represent the legal depiction of maritime limits.</gco:CharacterString>

        <gco:CharacterString>Marine Region GIS lab updates: As the California / Oregon border was not delineated for calculation or boundary purposes, the file was modified to reflect California's boundary. The boundary line was not altered, just clipped out to the extent of California's borders. Also, only the 3 nautical mile line is included in this version. The territorial sea, contiguous zone, and EEZ have been omitted from this dataset for the purposes of including only California's state waters out to 3 nautical miles. == Original text document that accompanied the data set: "maritimelimits_teale_nad83.txt" Preliminary Metadata Processing Steps: 1.

The 9-nautical mile Natural Resource Boundary off the Gulf coast of Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico, and the Three Nautical Mile Line elsewhere remain in most cases the inner limit of Federal fisheries jurisdiction and the outer limit of the jurisdiction of the states. The territorial sea was extended from three to twelve nautical miles by Presidential Proclamation No. 5928 on December 27, 1988. Territorial Sea-- The territorial sea is delimited either from base points on the land mass (normally at the low-water line along the coast) or from baselines connecting such points in accordance with international law. The coastal state enjoys sovereignty and jurisdiction over the territorial sea subject to the right of innocent passage for foreign vessels. The maximum breadth of the territorial sea allowed under international law as reflected in the LOS Convention is twelve nautical miles. Contiguous Zone-- Presidential Proclamation No. 7219 on August 2, 1999 extended the Contiguous Zone from its prior limit of 12 nautical miles from the baseline to 24 nautical miles. Under international law, a contiguous zone is an area contiguous to a nation's territorial sea and in which the nation may exercise the control necessary to prevent infringement of its customs, fiscal, sanitation, or immigration laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea. It may also exercise the control necessary to punish infringement of the above laws and regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea. This Proclamation has limited immediate effect, because the contiguous zone is defined in various statutes and regulations in such a manner as to mean 12 nautical miles. As an example, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) both limit the contiguous zone to 12 nautical miles.

Traditionally, these maritime limits have been generated by hand from the low water line depicted on paper, U.S. nautical charts. Upon final approval by the U.S. Baseline Committee, these legally-binding maritime limits are applied to the next edition of nautical charts produced by the Marine Chart Division of OCS. Due to new cartographic production processes and the availability of digital products such as Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs), OCS has developed improved techniques for generating more accurate, digital maritime limits. Through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software such as CARIS' LOTS and ESRI's ArcGIS, the latest vector representations of these limits will be available to NOAA cartographers and the public. To create digital limits, the charted low water line is captured digitally and used as input to CARIS' LOTS: Limits and Boundaries software for the designation of a baseline. Once the limits are created, they are exported to a shapefile file using CARIS' Import SHP utility. These polyline shapefiles are contained within a zipped file. Purpose: This dataset is to be used as the source for the depiction of maritime limits on NOAA's paper nautical charts and electronic navigational charts. The maritime limits were constructed from baseline points that represent the most seaward, drying features at mean lower low water on NOAA's largest scale, latest edition, paper nautical charts of the area. These digital boundaries do NOT represent the legal depiction of the maritime limits.

The map projections were set to Mercator with a 0.001 meter X/Y resolution for Northern California. The map projections were set to Mercator with a .0002 meter X/Y resolution for Southern California. The two working mapping files were later blended together with a map projection set to Mercator with a .001 X/Y resolution. The scaling latitude used for the CARIS maps were determined by finding the midpoints between the northeast and southwest bounding coordinates of each project area. The baseline points were derived from the largest scale charts. As NOAA's raster nautical charts were brought into the CARIS environment, the CARIS map was reprojected on the fly to match the chart's projection. To aid in the baseline point designation process, NOAA utilized the Extracted Vector Shoreline product. This product contains the vector low water line extracted from source binary raster files which are compiled to create the paper nautical chart. The Extracted Vector Shoreline was adjusted to achieve a 1 to 1 correspondence between it and the raster nautical chart. In some instances, the Extracted Vector Shoreline did not provide full coverage; therefore, heads-up digitizing in the CARIS environment was necessary. Once the baseline was determined, limit lines were projected through a method called envelope of arcs. Each limit line was attributed after export from LOTS to shpfile format. The attributes are Limit, Location, State, Approved Date, Source Scale Range, Begining Chart Year, Ending Chart Year, and Chart Datum. No added tests were conducted. Logical_Consistency_Report: The data, which reflects the largest scale nautical charts of the area, are believed to be logically consistent. Completeness_Report: The maritime limits are complete for California. The limits may be updated at a later date if the charted depiction of the farthest seaward low-water mark changes. These limits were created for internal purposes only to improve the accuracy of the charted maritime limits. These limits are not designed for legal purposes. For a legal depiction of the limits, please see NOAA's paper or raster nautical charts. Positional_Accuracy: Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy: Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: No specific test was performed on the dataset. The data is a reflection of the largest scale raster nautical charts of the area. The number of decimal places used in the output format does not imply an accuracy level higher than the source chart documents. Vertical_Positional_Accuracy: Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The maritime limits are projected from a designated baseline. Points representing the baseline are referenced from the farthest seaward low-water mark as depicted on the largest scale, raster nautical charts. No specific test was used to determine the vertical accuracy of the points.

NOAA's Extracted Vector Shoreline (EVS) was used when available to make the job of boundary delimitation more efficient. The EVS' mean lower low water and mean high water lines were merged using Safe's Feature Manipulation Engine (FME) to a single low water line. Modification of the EVS occurred in the CARIS environment to achieve a 1 to 1 relationship between the raster nautical chart and the extracted low water line. In some cases, either not enough information was provided in the EVS or there was no EVS available for a particular chart. In these cases, the low water line was delineated through heads-up digitizing in the CARIS environment. The resulting vector low water line was used as input to the "Envelope of Arcs" tool. This vector low water line corresponds to the latest edition raster nautical chart as referenced in the citation information section above. The dates of these latest editions were current as of 2005.
