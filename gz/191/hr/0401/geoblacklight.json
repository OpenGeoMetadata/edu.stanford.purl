  "dc_description_s": "This polyline shapefile depicts the Potential Flooding and Dam Inundation Zones on the Trinity River in the County of Humboldt, California in relation to the Trinity Dam. Flooding can cause the inundation of a normally dry area caused by high flow or overflow of water in an established watercourse. This coverage displays the portion of the Trinity River that flows through the County of Humboldt, California where it drains into the Pacific Ocean. Fully constructed by 1962, the Trinity Dam is hydroelectric and stands 457 feet tall with a 2,447,650 acre feet reservoir capacity (Trinity Lake). The lower and middle sections of the Klamath River are most vulnerable to flooding, of which the Trinity River is a tributary. The Humboldt County Planning and Building Department is responsible for protecting the public health, safety and welfare via building permit review and inspections consistent with California model codes as well as planning and development review and approval consistent with the county's General Plan. This Department oversees the Advance Planning Division, which is responsible for the Humboldt County's Geographic Information System (GIS) that is utilized by other County Departments; many federal, state and local agencies; and the general public. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
