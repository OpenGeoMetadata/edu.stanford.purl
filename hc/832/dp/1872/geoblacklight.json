  "dc_description_s": "This GeoTIFF contains multibeam backscatter (acoustic reflexivity) imagery extraced from gridded bathymetry data of Monterey Bay, California. This layer shows the entire multibeam survey area. Original bathymetric data were collected in 1998 using a 30kHz hull-mounted Simrad EM300 multibeam echo sounder system. This layer represents the entire coverage area of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute Multibeam Survey. Grids for this coverage area have cell size of 40 meters. This layer is part of the MBARI Monterey Bay Multibeam Survey collection, a compilation of data and imagery of the Monterey Bay and the adjacent seafloor, including coastline, imagery, and bathymetry. This collection of data provides documented layers of of the Monterey Bay to persons/institutions of interest throughout the research and educational communities. These maps help define the geological variability of the seafloor and provide a detailed framework for future oceanographic research, monitoring, and management activities. Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. (2000) Acoustic Backscatter Image: MBARI Monterey Bay Mulitbeam Survey Area, 1998. Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/hc832dp1872 This layer was acquired from a CD-ROM compiled by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) during the Fall of 2000. It is intended to be used in conjunction with ArcView® (with the Spatial Analyst Extension), ArcExplorer (TM), or ARC/INFO® Geographic Information System (GIS) software by ESRI.  Users of other software will need to import the ascii files or convert the ESRI formats.",
