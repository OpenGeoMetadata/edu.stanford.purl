  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains the locations of butchers in Paris, France from the end of the Middle Ages until the late 18th century. This layer includes the locations of butchers in relation to sewers, fountains, and wells. The ALPAGE programme aims to provide collaborative tools for the Humanities and Social Sciences and for Information Communication Technology (ICT) allowing for the development of research about the Parisian urban area. This aim is achieved by means of a GIS that includes cadastral and historical layers. APUR Â© ALPAGE: L. Mirlou and B. Descamps, 2013. This data is a direct result of the work of the researchers from the ALPAGE consortium who released this data under an Open Data Commons Open Database Licence (ODbL). Therefore, use of this data by others must respect the legal requirements specific to this licence. All freely downloadable data contains the shapefiles, metadata file and licence files describing the users rights and responsibilities.
