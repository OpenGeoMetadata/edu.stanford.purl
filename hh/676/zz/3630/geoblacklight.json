  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents airports in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. This layer includes 1:1 million scale data from Global Map. The data are a modified version of the National Atlas of the United States 1:1,000,000-scale airports of the United States; those source data were derived from an extract of the Public-Use Airports database of the National Transportation Atlas Databases-2010 (NTAD-2010), published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Department of Transportation. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States.Global Map data are part of a cooperative effort among national mapping organizations around the world to produce and maintain a standard set of basic cartographic data that supports global investigations of natural and human-built environments. Participating nations prepare data using a common data structure and description to ensure compatibility and to tangibly promote the tenets of the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.",
