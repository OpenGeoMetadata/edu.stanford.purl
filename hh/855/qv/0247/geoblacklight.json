In 1992 it was merged with the Qurghonteppa (Kurgan-Tyube) Oblast to create Khatlon Province. The city of Kulob (Kulyab) was the capital of the oblast. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.
