  "dc_description_s": "The Satellite View of Hawaii, with Shaded Relief map layer is a 200-meter-resolution simulated-natural-color image of Hawaii. Vegetation is generally green, with forests in darker green and grasslands or pasture in lighter green. Areas of volcanic rock and soil are represented by shades of brown. The image was produced by combining Landsat Thematic Mapper(TM) imagery from the Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 satellites with relief enhanced by shading. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition National Atlas of the United States. The Satellite View with Shaded Relief image was developed to portray the terrain and land cover of Hawaii. The image is intended for visual purposes only. The original Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and National Elevation Dataset (NED) data must be used for conducting analysis. National Atlas of the United States. (2005). Satellite View of Hawaii with Shaded Relief. National Atlas of the United States. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/hk213mj4227. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
