  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts the boundary of the San Francisco Bay in California, including San Pablo Bay and the Carquinez Straight, onto which other thematic data can be layered. This cartographic coverage provides a reference point for the size of the San Francisco Bay, which is approximately 280,000 acres depending on whether San Pablo Bay and the Carquinez Straight is included. This layer is part of the Conservation Lands Network regional biodiversity GIS database. This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.
