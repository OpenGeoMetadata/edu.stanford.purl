  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts fueling facilities that offer fuels other than gasoline in the United States. Through a nationwide network of local coalitions, Clean cities provides project assistance to help stakeholders in the public and private sectors deploy alternative and renewable fuels, idle-reduction measures, fuel economy improvements and emerging transportation technologies. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) collected this data as part of the Projects undertaken by Clean Cities coalitions and stakeholders to ensure customers access to clean alternative energy. This data can be found at the United States DOE Alternative Fuels Data Center Web Feature Service: http://www.afdc.energy.gov/locator/stations/ . Clean Cities is the deployment arm of the United States DOE's Vehicle Technologies Office. This layer is part of the 2014 National Transportation Atlas Database.The National Transportation Atlas Databases 2014 (NTAD2014) is a set of nationwide geographic datasets of transportation facilities, transportation networks, associated infrastructure and other political and administrative entities. These datasets include spatial information for transportation modal networks and intermodal terminals, as well as the reÂ¬lated attribute information for these features. This data supports research, analysis, and decision-making across all transportation modes. It is most useful at the national level, but has major applications at regional, state and local scales throughout the transportation community. The data used to compile NTAD2014 was provided by our partners within the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and by other agencies throughout the United States Federal Government. These contributors are the actual data stewards and are ultimately responsible for the maintenance and accuracy of their data. More than 250 million vehicles consume millions of barrels of petroleum every day in the United States. On-road passenger travel alone accounts for more than 2.5 trillion vehicle miles traveled each year. Vehicle fleet managers and drivers, corporate decision makers, and public transportation planners can use these strategies to conserve fuel.",
