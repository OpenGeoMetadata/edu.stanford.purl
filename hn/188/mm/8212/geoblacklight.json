  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile was created mostly from Digital Multi-Spectral Video image files and some were converted to image files from JPEG files. These data represent the 2005 California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) Survey flown between August and November of 2005. The photographs were taken from 10,500 feet, utilizing the CDFW's two Partenavia aircraft. Surveys were planned to coincide with periods of minimal change between high and low tides to avoid strong tidal induced currents and flown during early morning or late afternoon to avoid glare from overhead sun. The data from Los Angeles Harbor to LaJolla was provided by the Region Nine Kelp Consortium. These data were collected on March 15 and June 22, 2005. These data are complete, although the user should note ommissions. The coverage was projected in Teale Albers North American Datum 1983. File reindexed to match CDFW administrative kelp bed boundaries modified by changes to California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 165, effective April 1, 2014.These data are used to assess the extent of kelp canopy resources along the coast of California.",
