  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile, from the Santa Rosa Subregional Long-Term Wastewater Project, Anadromous Fish Migration Study Program reports, displays the Fyke net monitoring of salmonid from three Russian River tributaries, including two target streams and one control (Maacama Creek), which were monitored over five migration seasons (1990-1995). Fyke nets fished in upstream and downstream directions, however Fyke netting is only effective during low to moderate stream flow periods so data should not be used to estimate annual salmonid populations estimates. Data collected includes information for steelhead, coho and chinook adults and juveniles. The study period included both normal and unusually dry rainfall seasons. This shapefile provides data on salmonid behavior and physical characteristics during the migration season (October - April) from 1990 to 1995. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). Adult Salmonid Behavior and Characteristics, Russian River, California, 1990-1995. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/hn268wn9517 Records for individual adult salmonids (rr_adults) were only available for the 1993/94 and 1994/95 monitoring years. Data includes salmonids captured moving in both an upstream and downstream direction. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
