Available at http://purl.stanford.edu/hq541dw6224. GIS Layer Number = 10/ Boundary was first converted from 1\"=1000' Redevelopment Agency paper map to AutoCAD drawing file. This was plotted and then reviewed by the RDA staff. These data were compiled from many different sources; therefore, the accuracy of the individual layers varies significantly, and some layers do not align exactly with others. In the urban areas, data are generally accurate within five to ten feet of their true geographic coordinates, but in the rural areas, data may be accurate to only within three hundred feet. With these limitations, the County of Santa Cruz disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy or correctness of this data.
