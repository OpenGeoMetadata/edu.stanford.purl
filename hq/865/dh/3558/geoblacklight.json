Intercity passenger rail services provide transportation between metropolitan areas, to rural areas of California, and to points beyond California’s borders. California’s intercity rail services can be divided into two groups: 1) state-supported routes, which are funded by the State and serve California travel markets; and 2) Amtrak long-distance routes, which are funded by Amtrak and serve California and interstate markets. This feature class includes four Amtrak long-distance intercity passenger rail routes in California: California Zephyr (Emeryville – Sacramento – Reno – Denver – Chicago), Coast Starlight (Los Angeles – Oakland – Sacramento – Portland – Seattle), Sunset Limited (Los Angeles-San Antonio-New Orleans), and Southwest Chief (Los Angeles – Albuquerque – Kansas City – Chicago). ). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).",
