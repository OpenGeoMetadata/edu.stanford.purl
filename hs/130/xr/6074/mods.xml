  <abstract displayLabel="Abstract" lang="eng">This point shapefile depicts centroid locations of Local Fire Department and Service Districts Fire Hydrants in the County of Humboldt, California. Not all Fire Hydrant locations and specs have been verified.</abstract>
  <abstract displayLabel="Purpose" lang="eng">The Humboldt County Planning and Building Department is responsible for protecting the public health, safety and welfare via building permit review and inspections consistent with California model codes as well as planning and development review and approval consistent with the county's General Plan. This Department oversees the Advance Planning Division, which is responsible for the Humboldt County's Geographic Information System (GIS) that is utilized by other County Departments; many federal, state and local agencies; and the general public. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.</abstract>

  <note displayLabel="Supplemental information">Original Data Scale: Unknown

Updates/History/Corrections: Based on information provided in two fire
response capability surveys. The survey data was gathered over a 15-month
period in 2003 and 2004. This data will continue to be refined over time
as necessary. City of Eureka, City of Arcata, and Humboldt Community
Services District hydrants data were incorporated into this data set.

Shelter Cove Hydrants from CDF
(see h:\gis1\hazards\fire\2003CDF\sheltercove\hydrantsnew) were merged into
dataset and previous Shelter Cove hydrants were deleted.
CDF data was GPS locations.

Added attributes
[Elev_ft] - Elevation in Feet from FRAP DEM (except Shelter Cove)
[y_ft_sp27] - Northing in State Plane Zone 1 NAD27 Units Feet
[x_ft_sp27] - Easting in State Plane Zone 1 NAD27 Units Feet</note>
  <note displayLabel="Use limitation">The County of Humboldt makes no guarantee of the quality or completeness of this data. It has not been fully reviewed for accuracy and is intended to be used for planning purposes only. The department assumes no liability or responsibility in the use of this data. While every effort has been made to assure the accuracy of this information, it should be understood that it does not have the force and effect of law, rule, or regulation. In the event of any difference or error, the law will take precedence. The accuracy of map data varies from location to location in the county. While the GIS is useful for planning purposes, it should not be relied upon to determine property, zoning or general plan designation boundaries or be used in any way for project design. All GIS data should be verified before it is materially relied upon for property or project planning. In urban areas the GIS map data maybe inaccurate by as much as 50 feet in any direction. In rural areas the map data may be inaccurate by as much as 400 feet in any direction.</note>
