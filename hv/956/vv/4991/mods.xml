The ownpax data of the surface ownership layer is intended to illustrate state wide and regional land ownership.

BLM obtained the spatial data (linework) from the California State Lands Commission, who had digitized the California coastline from USGS 1:24,000-scale quads. BLM then added geographic place names and ownership codes. The Department of Fish and Game obtained the data from BLM and modified the attribute table to include Owner names.

The rispca are the Rocks and Islands polygon information The cstlca are the lines that depict the coast line. The original metadata is included in the sudirectory metadata. The coverage has been changed from the original. The rocks and islands have been separated from the coast line and built into polygons then converted to shapefiles. The rocks have been identified by name (when applicable) and ownership (as best as could be determined). The ownership metadata (for BLM ownership data which is not included) contains the labels for the ownership attributes.

Large land holders are emphasized in detail and they are Federal, State, and local governments. Private land owners are, for the most part, simply carried as private, generalizing this group as one. Purpose: The ownpax coverages may be used for illustration and mapping, analyzing public lands distribution, and conducting inventories over public lands. Supplemental_Information: Procedures Used: The Californiz land ownership layer was digitized by FRRAP of the CA Dept. of Forestry from mylar separates of the BLM 1:100,000 surface management quads as supplemented by ownership information from the USFS and other sources. FRRAP also edged matched the quads into one continuous data set. FRRAP digitized the layer into Arc/Info. Subsequent to this the Teale Data Center took over storage and management of the layer. Teale in turn snapped the arcs of the ownership layer to arcs of the public land grid layer. It was at this point that the BLM in California purchased the data set from the Teale Data Center. Since obtaining the ownership data set, BLM CA has added updates of its own on at first a project by project basis, and recently in a systematic state wide fashion. BLM has also altered the info table structure of the data set. BLM CA has added a ownpca.met table used to document revisions at the feature level, and other related data revision items. In 1998, CA BLM split the coverage into separate one degree area coverages to facilitate the accelerated update and maintenance of the data, particularly as it simplified the participation of Field Offices in the maintenance process. Revisions: The data set is currently under revision. No formal revision schedule or revision numbering ro release system is in place. Revisions are done on an as-needed, project basis. The exception to this is that a systematic state wide revision of BLM lands only was completed in December, 1998 in preparation for use in the production of a new BLM California State Map - a lithographic cartographic product. BLM will also use this update in cooperating with the Teale Data Center in helping them to maintain their version of the data set. This information will be supplied to Teale in the first quarter of 1999. Other groups of State and Federal agencies are clammoring for a thorough update to the data set, and a major version release may occur through Teale some time prior to 2005. Review Applied to the Data: FRRAP reviewed status information and edge mathcing for the data set Teale Data Center reviewed the data set against the PLSS. The BLM is currently reviewing the status data against our Master Title Plats on a township by township basis in a systematic fashion. BLM CA is also reviewing the coordinate geometry of the nodes and arcs where GCDB data is available. Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets: Additional tabular data sets area as follows: owner.lut is a look up table used for shading the data set on screen and for plotting. It contains the owner item codes from ownpca.pat and a shade value for an internally developed shade table called inkjetown.shd - developed for HP 755 cm ink jet plotters. The table owner.name contains the owner codes stored in ownpca.pat, with the owner name in another item. Owner.met contains metadata at the feature level for edits of the status, gcdb coordinate use on nodes and arcs, and editing of the arcs. Other Reference Cited: FRRAP, CA Department of Forestry, 1990, California Land Ownership Layer, CA Dept of Forestry, Sacramento, CA. Notes: The data set maintained by BLM CA was placed in MOSS at the time that it was purchased from the Teale Data Center. Subsequently, the data set was moved to a Unix based Arc/Info double precision coverage where it now resides. More recently, the coverage was split into many coverages, each covering a one degree area.

FRRAP of the CA Department of Forestry digitized the data from the base maps. The Teale Data Center mainatained the data after that, until the BLM purchased a version in 1991. Since that time, BLM has made significant modifications to the data set for its own internal requirements. Teale continues to maintain the version used by many organizations withing California.

The purpose of this rebuild is to reduce the number of verticies that are dropped out during an ARCINFO "CLEAN" process on a previous version of this coverage. This data set closely resembles the original data, and as such, users will probably want to generalize this coverage to decrease unwanted verticies and arcs. California shoreline from the Oregon border to the Mexico border including Humboldt, Arcata, San Francisco, San Pablo, Suisun, Honker, and San Diego Bays and includes offshore rocks. This shoreline represents the mean high tide line along the coast and bays as shown on the US Geological Survey 7.5' series quadrangles.

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT: The following are subjective comments regarding this data. This coverage has been compiled from individually digitized 7.5' USGS quadrangles controlled by NGS triangulation stations and individual quad corners. RMS errors averaged under 5 meters per quad. Accuracy of this coverage is very good with respects to the original source material. The shoreline between the Mare Island and Cuttings Wharf quads did not match. The Cuttings Warf quad was completed in 1949 and the Mare Island quad was completed in 1959. The differences were assumed to have resulted from the the different mapping dates. Consequently, the shoreline of the quad with the later date, the Mare Island quad, was held and the shoreline of the Cuttings Wharf quad was manually adjusted to fit. Not all of the quadrangles were current, since we could not afford new mylar sets. You will find some differences between our shoreline and the most recent USGS quadrangles. This shoreline will be updated on an ongoing basis. The marine terminal facility known as Pacific Wharf situated on the east side of San Pablo Bay alongside the main channel of the bay and west of the Unocal's Wharf at Oleum (Mare Island Quad), was positioned from registered and rectified air photos. The method used to position the facility was as follows: 1. The scanned air photo was registered with the coastline coverage then rectified; 2. The facility was then digitized in arcedit with a mouse from the registered and rectified scanned air photo.
