  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile identifies 194 marine and inland port locations used by marine fisheries for the landing and sale of fish and invertebrates. Each port has a code identifier which is linked to fishery landings at that port. The code is referenced in several fishery datasets owned and managed by the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Port identification and location is used to analyze and map marine fishery activities by geographic region throughout California. Some port points were created by screen digitizing the geographic point of the city or harbor. Not relevant California Department of Fish and Wildlife Marine Resources Region. (2010). California Coastal Inland Ports, 2010. California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Marine Resources Region. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/hx648sj2564. Converted to California Teale Albers Projection NAD 83 by California Departement of Fish and Game, Marine Region GIS Port codes have been used in California marine fisheries for several decades. Throughout the history of their use, CDFG has employed and enforced different standards for acceptable fish landing location and documentation. Many of these ports are located inland, from a time when vessels could easily travel up rivers and land their catch away from the coast. Some ports are in land-locked counties because fishermen could take and sell the catch in their home cities. While many of these activities are now prohibited, historic data is linked to ports throughout the state. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
