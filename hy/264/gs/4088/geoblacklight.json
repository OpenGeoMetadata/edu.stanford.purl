  "dc_description_s": "The Satellite View of the Conterminous United States, with Shaded Relief map layer is a 200-meter-resolution simulated-natural-color image of the United States, delivered in the Albers Equal-Area Conic map projection. Vegetation is generally green, with forests in darker green and grasslands or shrublands in lighter green. Areas of high reflectance, including urban areas, rock, and dry bare soil, are shown in shades of pink. Very bright areas, such as snow and ice, are colored blue. The image was produced by combining Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery from the Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 satellites with relief enhanced by shading. This map layer was previously distributed as Satellite View of the Conterminous United States. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition National Atlas of the United States. The Satellite View with Shaded Relief image was developed to portray the terrain and land cover of the conterminous United States. The image is intended for visual purposes only. The original Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and National Elevation Dataset (NED) data must be used for conducting analysis. National Atlas of the United States. (2005). Satellite View of the Conterminous United States, with Shaded Relief. National Atlas of the United States. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/hy264gs4088. Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 satellites carry sensors that detect reflected or emitted energy from the Earth in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The sensors operate in seven spectral bands. For more information on the Landsat satellites, see the Landsat Fact Sheet at &lt;http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/factsheets/fs02303.html&gt;. The associated world file is included as part of the GeoTIFF. The contents of the world file are: &gt;200.0000 &gt;0.000000 &gt;0.000000 &gt;-200.0000 &gt;-2262900.0000 &gt;1038900.0000 The following projection file can be used when using ESRI's ArcGIS to view the GeoTIFF (any line breaks should be removed): PROJCS[\"NAD_1983_Lambert_Azimuthal_Equal_Area\",GEOGCS [\"GCS_Sphere_ARC_INFO\",DATUM[\"D_Sphere_ARC_INFO\",SPHEROID [\"Sphere_ARC_INFO\",6370997.0,0.0]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0.0], UNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION [\"Lambert_Azimuthal_Equal_Area\"],PARAMETER[\"False_Easting\",0.0], PARAMETER[\"False_Northing\",0.0],PARAMETER[\"Central_Meridian\", -100.0],PARAMETER[\"Latitude_Of_Origin\",45.0],UNIT[\"Meter\",1.0]] The clipped elevation grid used to create the shaded relief, the land/water mask used to clip the image, and the U.S. land/non-U.S. land mask used to set the color for areas outside the United States, all of which were used to create this image, are available on request. Please contact the National Atlas at atlasmail@usgs.gov for more information. See the Cross Reference for information on obtaining the clipped Satellite View used to create this image. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
