  "dc_description_s": "This data set is a digital general soil association map developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The soil maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps are not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate are assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas are studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils are determined STATSGO depicts information about soil features on or near the surface of the Earth. These data are collected as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). Soil Map: Russian River Basin, California, 1994. Circuit Rider Productions.\n Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/hz363gw4355 Map unit composition for a STATSGO map is determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and\nexpanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit.\n\nThis data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are collected in 1-\nby 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged and distributed as statewide coverages. The soil map units are\nlinked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record relational data base which gives the proportionate extent of\nthe component soils and their properties. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
