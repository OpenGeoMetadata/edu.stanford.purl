The polygons represent lake shorelines with attributes including lake names and unique IDs. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Department of Fish and Game.

The polygons represent lake shorelines, with attributes including lake names and unique IDs. The intended use of this data set is to assist with fisheries programs management. ----- VITAL STATISTICS: Standard Teale Parameters Datum: NAD 27 Projection: Albers Units: Meters 1st Std.

This code is particularly useful for common lake names such as 'Bear Lake', 'Cold Lake', etc... __ Item D_SOURCE Code Meaning DFG_FPB = Originated from Lakes_24k dataset. Produced by Department of Fish and Game, Fisheries Programs Branch. DFG_ITB = Originated from Lakes dataset. Produced by Department of Fish and Game, Information Technology Branch. USDA_USFS = Originated from Sn_lakes dataset. Produced by the United States Department of Agriculture, United States Forest Service. ----- COVERAGE PROCESSING METHODOLOGY: The fpb_lakes shapefile data set was produced, using ArcView's GeoProcessing Wizard, by merging the data sets Lakes, Sn_lakes and Lakes_24k together. Lakes was the specified data set upon which Sn_lakes and Lakes_24k were merged. EDITS TO LAKES The edits made to Lakes.shp were removal of duplicate polygons. Polygons that were duplicates of polygons in Sn_lake.shp were removed. Deletion based upon the following criteria: Sn_lakes.shp was digitized at 1:24,000 and Lakes.shp was digitized at 1:100,000. The edits made to Lakes.dbf were removal of the fields Lakes_ and Lakes_id. Both fields were generated, populated and used by the original ARC/INFO lakes coverage. Lakes_id was re-created and re-populated in ArcView to represent unique IDs for the lakes. __ EDITS TO SN_LAKES The sn_lakes data set was obtained as an ARCINFO e00 file from the USDA Forest Service through the California Department of Forestry then converted to an ArcView shapefile. Edits made to sn_lakes.shp was the deletion of land polygons. Criteria for deletion was based upon the Sn_lakes.dbf. Records with 0 in the Water Field were removed. 0s indicated land. The edits made to sn_lakes.dbf were the deletion of Lakes_id, Lcode and Cff_code fields. Lakes_id was generated, populated and used by the original ARC/INFO sn_lakes coverage. Lakes_id was re-created and re-populated in ArcView to represent unique ids for the lakes. Lcode identified water body types, Lakes; Island; Reservoir; and River. This information was reclassified in the Water field. Cff_code was generated from the integer codes of Geometronics CFF files. The 'Name' field was created and populated using USGS 7.5' topographic quads. ----- DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION OF RELATED ORIGINAL DATA SETS: ABSTRACT fpb_lakes was produced by merging the data sets Lakes, Sn_Lakes and Lakes_24k together.
