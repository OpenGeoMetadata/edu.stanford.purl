  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile portrays areas of milk surplus and deficit in central and western Kenya, 1997. Calculations of milk production were done by assessing the number of dairy cattle in an administrative area, and extrapolating out liters of milk per area. Demand for milk was calculated by estimating the milk needs per person, and applying that number to the population density of each area. Areas with more milk produced than needed by the population are considered \"surplus\" areas, while those with more demand than can be met by current production are considered to be in \"deficit.\" Many areas of the country produce more milk than they need locally. Hence, establishing good transportation and marketing systems for dairy could go a long way toward increasing the availability of milk in deficit areas.This data was used in Map 4.6 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being.",
