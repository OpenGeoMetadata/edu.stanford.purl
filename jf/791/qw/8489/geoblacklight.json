This layer is part of the Randolph Glacier Inventory (6.0). The Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI 6.0) is a global inventory of glacier outlines. It is supplemental to the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space initiative (GLIMS). Production of the RGI was motivated by the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5). RGI Consortium (2017).
