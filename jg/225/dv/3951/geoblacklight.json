These data cover hazardous waste regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 as amended. The original source for the statistical data is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, The National Biennial RCRA Hazardous Waste Report. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.
