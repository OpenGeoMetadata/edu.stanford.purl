    <field name="dc_title_s">Anadromous Stream Restoration Projects (Points): Russian River, California, 1981-2002</field>
    <field name="dc_description_s">This point shapefile contains the locations of completed projects (for which final reports have been received) funded through the California Department of Fish and Game's Fisheries Restoration Grants Program (FRGP). The shapefile was created by heads-up digitizing. Locations were taken from representations of stream habitat restoration projects marked on maps included in the paper documentation of the projects. Approximately 12% of projects sites (455/3850) could not be placed at specific locations.Line locations were originally digitized using two different methods. Instream locations were digitized by referencing them directly to the place along the stream in which the work was done. Locations that were not along streams were heads-up digitized. These two different shapefiles were merged into a single line shapefile for the purposes of this data release. See Supplimental Information for more details.This point dataset describes the geographic areas where restoration projects were completed through the California Department of Fish and Game's Fisheries Restoration Grants Program (FRGP), and is intended to be a comprehensive repository for anadromous stream restoration projects throughout California. </field>
