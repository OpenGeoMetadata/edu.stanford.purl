  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset is a georeferenced image containing land cover classifications developed as part of a study of oil palm expansion and deforestation in southwest Cameroon. Classifications represent the year 2000 and are divided into 5 land cover types: unclassified, mature oil palm, immature monoculture (65% immature oil palm), forest, and other. These data are referenced in the corresponding publication: Ordway et al. 2018. Oil palm expansion and deforestation in Southwest Cameroon associated with proliferation of informal mills. Nature Communications. These data are intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.",
