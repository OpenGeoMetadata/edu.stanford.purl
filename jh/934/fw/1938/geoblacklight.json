  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile displays the planning areas of the winners of the Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant competition for FY2010 and FY2011. Program applicants were required to designate their planning area according to a set of criteria given in the Notice of Funding Availability, which in most circumstances ensured that applicant geographies would be composed of counties, MSAs, or the planning areas of Metropolitan Planning Organizations. The majority of geographies in this file were assembled from county, MSA, and MPO shapefiles available on servers or publicly elsewhere. The remaining geographies used publicly available geospatial data such as municipal line files and tribal boundaries. Data Current As Of: 12/03/2014This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)",
