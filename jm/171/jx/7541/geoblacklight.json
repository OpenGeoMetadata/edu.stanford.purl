  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts boundaries for Depth to First Groundwater in feet for the County of Santa Clara, California groundwater subbasins. The depths to water measurements at fuel leak sites, as recorded in the fuel leak database (ZIM), were used to generate this coverage. This coverage presents a worst case, meaning it indicates the smallest depth to water (highest level) ever measured for an area. The time period of these measurements ranges from 1980 to just prior to 2003.The Santa Clara Valley Water District manages an integrated water resources system that includes the supply of clean, safe water, flood protection and stewardship of streams on behalf of Santa Clara County's 1.8 million residents. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Santa Clara County, California. To facilitate studies and understanding of the groundwater. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.
