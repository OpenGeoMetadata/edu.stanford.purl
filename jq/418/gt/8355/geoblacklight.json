These data were extracted from a layer titles 'Major Roads of California' (1997). Line features selected from the original source data were based on their spatial location within the extent of the Russian River basin. The intended purpose of this dataset is to provide users with a line feature type data layer at 1:100,000 scale that describes and illustrates the roads contained within the extent of the Russian River basin.
