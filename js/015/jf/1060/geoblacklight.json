  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents the coastline in Pakistan. This layer is part of Global Map version 2. The drainage and Transportation layers version 2 are prepared by using the digital 1:1000k data of nepal. The Global Map Nepal version 1.0 Boundaries layer was developed using The Digital Map 200000. Updating the data of version 1.0 using 1:500,000 District Map series and 1:1,000,000 International Map series developed the Global Map Nepal version 1.1 Boundary layer. Updating the Global Map Nepal version 1.1 using 1:1,000,000 Topographic Maps and other information developed the Global Map Nepal version 2.0 Boundary layer, which is corresponding to the merger of municipalities as of April 1, 2010. The Global Map Nepal version 1.0 Population center layer was developed using The 1:1,000,000 Chart International series. Updating the data of version 1.0 using The 1:500,000 District Map series and 1:1,000,000 International Map series developed the Global Map Nepal version 1.1 Population center layer. Updating the Global Map Nepal version 1.1 developed the Global Map Nepal version 2.0 Population center layer, which is corresponding to the merger of municipalities as of April 1, 2010. (Because the built-up area data of the Global Map Nepal is corresponding to the location of each municipality.) \t\t Global Map data were developed under the cooperation of National Geospatial Information Authorities (NGIAs) of respective countries and regions.",
