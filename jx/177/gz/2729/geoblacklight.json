  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents the depth to groundwater below the ground surface in California during spring of 2014. These data show depth to groundwater values collected from wells. Depth information is represented in feet below the ground surface. Increasing values indicate increasing depth to groundwater (or deeper/lower water levels). Negative values indicate that the groundwater level is above ground surface. Water level measurements are selected based on measurement data and well construction information (where available) and approximate groundwater levels in the unconfined to uppermost semi-confined aquifers.This layer is intended to be used as a compliment to data, reports, and other information provided by the California Groundwater Information Center.",
