    <abstract lang="eng" displayLabel="Abstract">This polygon shapefile depicts boundaries of Public Lands in the County of Humboldt, California, including Parcels and Land classified as Agriculture, City, Open Space/Parks, Public, Residential, School, Timber Production, Tribal Lands. This coverage icludes all unincorporated areas, as well as cities/incorporated areas. Cities data obtained from Arcata, Eureka and Trinidad. Please note the accuracy of GIS map data varies from location to location in the County. This GIS system is useful for planning purposes but should not be relied upon to determine property, zoning or general plan designation boundaries or be used in any way for project design. All GIS data should be verified before it is materially relied upon for property or project planning.</abstract>
    <abstract lang="eng" displayLabel="Purpose">The Humboldt County Planning and Building Department is responsible for protecting the public health, safety and welfare via building permit review and inspections consistent with California model codes as well as planning and development review and approval consistent with the county's General Plan. This Department oversees the Advance Planning Division, which is responsible for the Humboldt County's Geographic Information System (GIS) that is utilized by other County Departments; many federal, state and local agencies; and the general public. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.</abstract>

    <note displayLabel="Supplemental information">Updates/History/Corrections:  

This dataset is the result of an ongoing effort to produce a county wide parcel layer. Digitizing began as far back as 1996. More recently - 2000 to 2001 - digitizing effort has been increased in order to complete this dataset. Many corrections have been made to this dataset, using PLS lines, USGS Quads, Aerial photographs, and other sources where available. Most topological descrepencies have been corrected in this dataset. This data has been reviewed for spatial accuracy relative to the PLS lines as well as USGS 7.5 quads in some areas. This is the first version of the Humboldt County Parcel dataset that will need future review and revisions.  Land use attributes - exlu2 &amp; exlu4 - have been added. Existing Land Use values - exlu4 - were created using an interpretive method. Zoning, use codes, land ownership, and other information pertaining to parcels were used to create "existing" land use categories.
 
Jan. 2003 - Cities of Eureka and Rio Dell parcels were added to layer. Orleans and Willow Creek have been corrected.

March 2003 - Cities of Blue Lake and Fortuna were added to layer. Hydesville area has been correct using DOQQ's.

March - April 2003 APN's were checked and corrected for many parcels throughout the county.

Aug. 2003 - Updated Assessor Parcels were incorporated into dataset.

Jan. 2004 - Updated Assessor Parcels were incorporated into dataset.

Sept. 2004 - Added 14 missing Parcels for Williamson Contract mapping.

Dec. 2004 - Re-aligned parcels for the railroad right of way between Eureka and Arcata along HWY 101.  Fixed page 20338 parcel numbers.  

May 2005 - Updated Assessor Parcels were incorporated into dataset - plotting and plotting2.  City of Trinidad parcel lines were incorporated into dataset - trin_par4.  Re-aligned parcels from an outside consultantwere incorporated into dataset - mb.  See [source] attribute. Abbreviated Existing Land Use [exlu2] attribute was deleted. Existing Land Use [exlu4] attributes were updated for those parcels that changed from vacant to improved or vice versa. 

June 2005 - Eel Delta/Salt River - eeld - and Bridgeville Corrections - brgvl -incorporated into dataset.  Few minor corrections near intersection of Ridgewood Dr and Westgate Dr, South Eureka.

July 2005 - Updated City of Eureka Parcels were incorporated into dataset - [source] = "eka062305".  Significant re-alignment and adjustments were made to parcel lines in the areas of McKinleyville, Manila, Samoa, Fairhaven, Myrtletown, Cutten, Ridgewood Heights, and Elk River using aerial photographs, Assessor Maps, and Section Lines -
[source] = "cl072705".

Aug. 12, 2005 - 30704108 fixed.

Aug. 24, 2005 - Parcels near Arcata/McKinleyville Airport fixed and adjusted.  Parcels west of Rohnerville Airport adjusted. [Source] = 'cl082405'

Sept. 8, 2005 - redigitized in apn #10621205,03. Corrected parcels near Fernbridge.

December 28, 2005 (clewis) - Updated Assessor Parcels were incorporated into dataset - plotting4 [source] = "ez20050830".  Re-alignment adjustments were made to parcel lines in McKinleyville, South Eureka, Humboldt Hill, Hookton, Briceland, Garberville, &amp; Benbow - [source] = "cl20051221".  New date format adopted for source edits attributes - yyyymmdd.  Apn's 21224201, 02 fixed.

February 8, 2006 (clewis) - Updated Assessor Parcels were incorporated into dataset - plotting5 [source] = "jvd20051212".</note>
    <note displayLabel="Use limitation">The County of Humboldt makes no guarantee of the quality or completeness of this data. It has not been fully reviewed for accuracy and is intended to be used for planning purposes only. The department assumes no liability or responsibility in the use of this data. While every effort has been made to assure the accuracy of this information, it should be understood that it does not have the force and effect of law, rule, or regulation. In the event of any difference or error, the law will take precedence. The accuracy of map data varies from location to location in the county. While the GIS is useful for planning purposes, it should not be relied upon to determine property, zoning or general plan designation boundaries or be used in any way for project design. All GIS data should be verified before it is materially relied upon for property or project planning. In urban areas the GIS map data maybe inaccurate by as much as 50 feet in any direction. In rural areas the map data may be inaccurate by as much as 400 feet in any direction.</note>
