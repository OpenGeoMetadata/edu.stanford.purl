  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains province boundaries and (9.95 percent long form) population data from the 2010 census of China, including: employed population and migration, households and housing Information. This layer is part of the 2010 China Province Population Census Dataset. The population data came from the 6th China Population Census surveyed in 2010. The GIS data is based on the national digital map (1:1 million) developed by the National Geographic Information Center of China (NGCC), including rives, roads, residential area and administrative boundaries. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.
