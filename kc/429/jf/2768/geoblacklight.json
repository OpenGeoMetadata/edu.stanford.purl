  "dc_description_s": "Thiis point shapefile represents coastal and marine related boat marinas in San Mateo County, California. The California Department of Boating and Waterways provided the California Department of Fish and Game Marine Region GIS Lab with a boating facilities GIS dataset. The GIS Lab manually selected coastal and marine related marinas from the boating facilities dataset to create this dataset. Only the name field was used from the boating facilities dataset and the GIS Lab added and attributed the rest of the fields in the dataset. Some additional marinas were added that were not included in the boating facilities dataset. Source: California Department of Fish and Game Marine Region GIS Lab. This layer is part of the San Mateo County Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment Project. These data are intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.",
