  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents the portion of the lands administered and/or owned by DFG layer within the Russian River basin. These data were derived from a 2000 California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) layer for the entire state of California. Polygon features from the original source data were selected based on their spatial location within the extent of the Russian River basin. This layer can be used for watershed analysis and planning in the Russian River region of California. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). California Department of Fish and Game Lands: Russian River Basin, 2000. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/kc534gq4006 The DFGLANDS coverage is a digitized geographical inventory of\n    selected lands administered and/or owned by the California Department\n    of Fish and Game (DFG). Properties such as ecological reserves,\n    wildlife areas, undesignated lands containing biological resource\n    values, public and fishing access lands, and DFG fish hatcheries are\n    among those lands included in this inventory. Types of properties\n    owned or administered by DFG which may not be included in this coverage\n    are parcels less than 1 acre in size, such as DFG fishing piers, fish\n    spawning grounds, fish barriers, and other minor parcels pending mapping\n    and attribute assignment. All DFG properties (mapped herein or not)\n    are assigned a unique Real Property Number (PROP_NBR). A given property\n    may consist of one or more parcels, each identified by a unique Parcel\n    History Number (HIST_NBR). These two identifiers are assigned by the\n    State of California Department of General Services (DGS).\n \n    Physical boundaries of individual parcels are determined by the\n    descriptions contained in legal documents and assessor parcel maps\n    relating to that parcel. Parcel boundaries are drawn onto U.S.\n    Geological Survey 7.5'-series topographic maps, then digitized and\n    attributed before addition to the dfglands coverage. \" This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes.
