  "dc_description_s": "This polyline shapefile depicts centerlines, or breaklines, for 1 foot (Valley Area) and 5 foot (Mountain Areas) Top of Bank Contours in the County of Santa Clara, California. Breaklines were derived through photogrammetric techniques utilizing LiDAR intensity stereo-pairs. The Santa Clara Valley Water District manages an integrated water resources system that includes the supply of clean, safe water, flood protection and stewardship of streams on behalf of Santa Clara County's 1.8 million residents. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Santa Clara County, California.The purpose of the bare-earth LiDAR Point and Breakline data is to provide ground surface data, contour generation and the delineation of watercourse ( Top of Bank ). This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data. ",
