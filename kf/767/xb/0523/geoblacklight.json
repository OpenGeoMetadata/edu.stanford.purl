  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents natural gas market hubs in the United States for 1996-2009. A hub is a physical transfer point for natural gas where several pipelines are connected. A market center is a hub where the operator offers services that facilitate the buying, selling, and transportation of natural gas. This is a point dataset representing natural gas transmission hubs in the continguous U.S. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data produced by the U.S. National Energy Information Administration. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. National Energy Information Center (U.S.). (2013). Natural Gas Market Hubs, United States, 1996-2009. National Energy Information Center. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/kf767xb0523.
