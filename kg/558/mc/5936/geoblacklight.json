  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts the locations of 394 authorized Park Service units in the United States only that are over 100,000 acres. The data does not include affiliated areas and unauthorized park units. Park units over 100,000 acres appear as areas, park units under 100,000 acres as points, and linear parks, including rivers, trails, and seashores, as lines. There are a few exceptions to this rule. Many parks are comprised of scattered, non-contiguous land parcels. Not all of these are shown, especially in urban areas and the northeastern US. Dots generally indicate the center of the largest parcel or the parcel where the visitor center is located. Park boundaries extending over water areas are not shown. There are a few exceptions to this rule. Although National Preserves adjacent to National Parks are generally counted as separate units, they are typically administered jointly with their respective parks. This data reflects this administrative reality. Park shapes were generalized with the Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithm using the on-line tools at Mapshaper.org. this data was produced privately and is not an official product nor is it endorsed by the Park Service. These data are represented at 1:10,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0).Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software.",
