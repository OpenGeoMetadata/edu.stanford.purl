  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts urban land coverage for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region for 2004-2006. The data comes directly from the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP), which provides data to decision makers for assessing present status, reviewing trends and planning for the future of California's agricultural land resources. FMMP mapping coverage includes 49.1 million acres, 98% of the state's private lands and is based on the extent of the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service soil surveys. Most large government land holdings, including National Parks, Forests, and Bureau of Land Management land, are not included in the FMMP survey area. This layer is part of the Conservation Lands Network regional biodiversity GIS database. This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project and contributed to the developement of the Conservation Lands Network. Used for cartographic purposes, this layer can show urban land use in nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region. This is helpful for setting context, as most people recognize urban areas and cities. For example, knowing where Sacramento is located helps when showing a broad regional map.

This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
