  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile shows the official protraction diagram (OPD) and leasing map boundaries for the United States, covering areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) within Federal jurisdiction. They are generated in accordance with 30 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 256.8 to support Federal land ownership and mineral resource management. Leasing maps are irregularly shaped areas developed early in the offshore program for near-shore areas in the Gulf of Mexico. Elsewhere, OPD's were developed on a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid and are approximately one degree in latitude by two degrees in longitude, except in northern areas where they are three degrees in longitude. This map layer shows existing and planned OPD limits. Actual limits of Federal jurisdiction are defined by various international and maritime boundaries not presently depicted. Lease Map and OPD boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico were historically cut at the Submerged Lands Act (SLA) boundary, while in other areas the full OPD boundary is shown and therefore may include non-OCS lands within the rectangularly shaped OPD boundary. While the Gulf of Mexico Region uses the North American Datum of 1927, for this map layer those coordinates have been transformed to the North American Datum of 1983 to coincide with the OPD's in the other Minerals Management Service regions. This file updates the September 2000 map layer by including the OPD boundaries for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. Other sources must be used if exact coordinates are required for legal purposes.
