  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains the division boundaries for Pakistan in 1998. Divisions were the third tier of government in Pakistan, between the provinces and districts. They were abolished in 2000 by the government of former president Pervez Musharraf to make way for local governance via district governments. As of August 2008, divisions in some provinces have been restored with Punjab taking the lead and restoring its eight divisions. Population data from the 1998 census are also included for each division. This layer is part of a collection of data relating to administrative units in the Pakistan.This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
