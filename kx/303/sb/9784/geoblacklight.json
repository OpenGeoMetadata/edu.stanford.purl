  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains the locations of intercity passenger rail stations in California as of 2013. Intercity passenger rail services provide transportation between metropolitan areas, to rural areas of California, and to points beyond California’s borders. California’s intercity rail services can be divided into two groups: 1) state-supported routes, which are funded by the State and serve California travel markets; and 2) Amtrak long-distance routes, which are funded by Amtrak and serve California and interstate markets. This layer represents three state-supported intercity passenger rail routes:Pacific SurflinerRoute (San Luis Obispo – Los Angeles – San Diego), San Joaquin Route (Bay Area/Sacramento – Stockton – Bakersfield), and Capitol Corridor (San Jose – Oakland – Sacramento – Roseville/Auburn). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. California Department of Transportation. (2013). Intercity Passenger Rail Stations, California, 2013. California Department of Transportation. Available at http://purl.stanford.edu/kx303sb9784.

For planning purposes only. The Rail Database is intended for high level planning purposes and is a point in time reporting of estimated current conditions and forecast of future conditions. While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy of reported data, the Database is not intended for detailed service or facility planning. Such planning requires in-depth site analysis and field confirmation of actual conditions. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes.
