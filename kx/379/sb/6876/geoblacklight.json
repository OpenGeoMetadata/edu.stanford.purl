  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents all operable bulk petroleum product terminals located in the 50 States and the District of Columbia with a total bulk shell storage capacity of 50,000 barrels or more, and/or ability to receive volumes from tanker, barge, or pipeline. Survey locations were adjusted using public data. These data were gathered from \"EIA-815, Monthly Bulk Terminal and Blender Report.\" These data are current as of November 2014. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data produced by the U.S. National Energy Information Administration.This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
