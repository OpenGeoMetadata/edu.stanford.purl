  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents large scale irrigation schemes in Kenya, with the largest located at the foothills of Mount Kenya. This includes Kenya’s largest irrigation investment, the Mwea-Tebere rice irrigation scheme. Covering more than 6,100 hectares, this area produces most of Kenya’s rice. Other irrigated areas are located close to Kisumu (where sugar cane is produced) and along the lower Tana River (which produces citrus and rice). These data were derived from FAO's Africover dataset.This data was used in Map 3.12 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being.",
