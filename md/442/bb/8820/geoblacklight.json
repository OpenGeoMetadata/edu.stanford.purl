This layer includes data from surveys available from California Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This dataset is intended signify which streams in the Russian River basin have historically supported chinook, coho, or steelhead salmonids. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). Historical Salmonid Streams of the Russian River Basin, California, 1920-2000. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/md442bb8820 In 1995, Ken Bunzel, former GIS assistant to Bob Coey, then the Russian River Basin Planner for CA DFG, clipped the EPA reach file 3 hydrology to the Russian River basin. Ken Bunzel and Bob Coey surveyed available CA DFG and US Army Corps of Engineers files for historical salmonid stream references, and attributed the stream segments with a species code for those historical streams. As other historical files were found in 1997-2002, Colin Brooks updated this historical streams database and the resulting maps in ArcView 3.2. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
