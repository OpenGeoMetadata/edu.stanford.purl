  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a digital raster graphic (DRG) of a scanned nautical chart entitled Port of Rouen. It was published by the Defense Mapping Agency, 3rd Ed., April 1997. Scale 1:15035. Covers Port of Rouen, France in two panels. Panel A covers Seine River from La Bouille to Biessard. Panel B covers Seine River from Le Petit Couronne to Rouen. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced maps from The Branner Library Map Collection at Stanford University. Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change. As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data. CREDIT This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
