  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset depicts the population denisty of the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California produced with a Dasymetric Mapping Technique, which is used to depict quantitative areal data using boundaries that divide an area into zones of relative homogeneity with the purpose of better portraying the population distribution. The source data was then adjusted in order to get convert the units to persons per acre. This dataset is an accurate representation of population distribution within census boundaries and can be used in a number of ways, including as the Conservation Suitability layer for the Marxan inputs and the watershed integrity analysis. This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.
