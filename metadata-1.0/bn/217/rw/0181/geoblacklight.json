  "dc_description_s": "A renewable energy resource web site of global meteorology and surface solar energy climatology from NASA satellite data on one by one degree resolution. NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (POWER) Project is developing data sets from Earth Science Enterprise climate research to support renewable energy industries. The Surface meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) data set contains solar parameters principally derived from satellite observations and meteorology parameters from an atmospheric model constrained to satellite and sounding observations. It is a 22-year climatology (July 1983- June 2005) on a one-degree latitude by one-degree longitude grid. The global coverage of the SSE data set fills the gap where remote locations lack ground measurement data. Most ground measurement stations are located near populated regions that may have natural or urban influence on the local climate. The SSE data set can augment ground measurement data affected by microclimates. There are parameters for sizing and pointing solar panels, solar thermal applications, cloud information, temperature, humidity, and wind parameters. The SSE data are considered accurate for preliminary feasibility studies of renewable energy projects. Shapefile data downloaded from OpenEI (http://en.openei.org) on June 16, 2014. System requirements: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software that reads ESRI shapefile format.",
