  "dc_description_s": "Digital geospatial data sets for two maps (Plate 1, Elk River watershed, Humboldt County, California, geologic and geomorphic features related to landsliding; and plate 2, Elk River watershed, Humboldt County, California, relative landslide potential with geologic and geomorphic features). These maps portray landslides, geomorphic features related to landsliding, relative landslide potential, geology, and stream channel geomorphic conditions in the Elk River watershed, Humboldt County, California. The GIS data are organized into four groups: landslide layers; geomorphology layers; fluvial layers; geology layers. by Gerald J. Marshall and Eric Mendes. Title from CD surface. Relief shown by contours. Includes text, Geologic and geomorphic features related to landsliding and landslide potential in the Elk River watershed / by Gerald J. Marshall and Eric Mendes. \"Landslide and geomorphic features were mapped/compiled at a scale of 1:24,000 (1 inch equals 2000 feet). The geologic data were also compiled at 1:24,000...Accuracy of the map features in this database are not implied at scales larger than 1:24,000.\"--Metadata file. PDF images of maps  include bibliographical references.
