Several State Plane Coordinate System zones are not shown in this dataset, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and Louisiana's offshore zone. This layer is part of the 2014 ESRI Data and Maps collection for ArcGIS 10.2. U.S. State Plane Zones (NAD 1983) is generalized and an approximation of the actual State Plane Coordinate System zone boundaries for the 1983 North American Datum. It is intended for visual reference at small and medium map scales. Please check with state authorities if you have a question about a zone boundary. ESRI. (2014). U.S. State Plane Zones (NAD 1983).
