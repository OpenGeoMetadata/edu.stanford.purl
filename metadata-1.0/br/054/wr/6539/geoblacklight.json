  "dc_description_s": "This raster layer contains a color sun illuminated relief image in GeoTIFF format of bathymetric data collected from the Lower Lucia Canyon region of Monterey Bay, California. These data were gathered as part of the 1998 Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) Multibeam Survey of Monterey Bay, California. Original bathymetric data were collected in 1998 using a 30kHz hull-mounted Simrad EM300 multibeam echo sounder system. Grids for this coverage area have cell size of 25 meters. This layer is part of the MBARI Monterey Bay Multibeam Survey collection, a compilation of data and imagery of the Monterey Bay and the adjacent seafloor, including coastline, imagery, and bathymetry. This collection of data provides documented layers of of the Monterey Bay to persons/institutions of interest throughout the research and educational communities. These maps help define the geological variability of the seafloor and provide a detailed framework for future oceanographic research, monitoring, and management activities. Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. (2000) Color Shaded Relief Image: Lower Lucia Canyon, Monterey Bay, California, 1998. Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/br054wr6539 The lower part of Lucia Canyon crosses the continental slope platform at a depth of about 1,800 meters to the north of the pockmark field. Here the seafloor gently dips 1.4º to the west and is sediment covered with isolated bedrock exposures. The western part of this mid-slope platform is marked by a steeper slope (7º) and forms the lower slope in this region, ranging from 2,000-3,500 meters. Many rills and landslide scars characterize the lower slope.\n\nAt the base of the lower slope, Lucia Canyon makes a 90° turn to the south and parallels the slope for at least 50 kilometers. In this area sediment overflow from the canyon forms levees and overbank deposits.",
