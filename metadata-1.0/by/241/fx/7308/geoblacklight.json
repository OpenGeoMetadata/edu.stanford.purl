  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset is a grid of world countries. These are the standard country boundaries. Also included is a DBF (countries.dbf) giving the country name for each country \"number\" in the grid and has demographic factors similar to the Admin1 table. This dataset is part of the LandScan global 2014. The LandScan global 2014 was developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for the United States Department of Defense (DoD). This dataset contains boundary information for understanding and analyzing population statistics. Oak Ridge National Laboratory. (2015). LandScan 2014 World Country Boundaries. Oak Ridge National Laboratory, UT-Battelle, LLC. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/by241fx7308. For correct population analysis using ESRI products assure that the following parameters are set:\nUse ONLY Geographic, WGS84 projection parameters.\nSpatial Analysis cell size is 0.008333333333333 (double precision)\nSpatial Analysis extent should be set to an exact multiple of the cell size (for example 35.25, 35.50, 35.0)\nConverting (including on-the-fly projections) a grid to other projections or coordinate systems causes population cells to be re-sampled, and hence population counts will be incorrect.\nIn ESRI ArcMap, load the LandScan grid first in order to maintain the original geographic (lat-lon) projection. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
