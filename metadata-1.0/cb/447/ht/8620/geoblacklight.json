  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile was created from Digital Multi-Spectral Video image files and represents the 2004 California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) Survey flown between September and November of 2004. The photographs were taken from 10,500 feet, utilizing the CDFW's two Partenavia aircraft. Surveys were planned to coincide with periods of minimal change between high and low tides to avoid strong tidal induced currents and flown during early morning or late afternoon to avoid glare from overhead sun. These data are complete, although the user should note ommissions. The coverage was projected in Teale Albers North American Datum 1983. File reindexed to match CDFW administrative kelp bed boundaries modified by changes to California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 165, effective April 1, 2014. This coverage can be used to assess the extent of kelp canopy resources along the California coast. California Department of Fish and Wildlife Marine Resources Region. (2005).
