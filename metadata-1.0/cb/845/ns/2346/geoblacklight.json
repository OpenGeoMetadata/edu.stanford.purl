Isobaths surrounding islands, seamounts, and near other steep slopes received considerable manual generalization to improve legibility. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0). Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software. Kelso, N.V. and Patterson, T. (2012). World Bathymetry, -5000 Meter Depths, 1:10 million (2012). Made with Natural Earth, online at http://www.naturalearthdata.com.",
