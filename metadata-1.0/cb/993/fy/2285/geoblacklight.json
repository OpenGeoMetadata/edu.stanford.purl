  "dc_description_s": "This point dataset contains the locations and names of features of interest in the Russian Watershed region of California. The source of this point coverage is the U.S. Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) datafiles. These files are compiled mainly from USGS map products such as the 7.5' 1:24,000 quads. Users should remember that these feature types are not exhaustive. For example, reselecting schools will not give you every California school, but it will furnish a large number of school locations. The features presented are the same ones as seen on USGS map sheets. This layer is useful for furnishing landmarks on plots. It can also serve as a base data layer. The features help to orient the viewer and give a sense of scale to the plot. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). Geographic Names: Russian River Basin, California, 1992. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/cb993fy2285 This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
