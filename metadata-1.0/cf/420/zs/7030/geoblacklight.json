  "dc_description_s": "by Map Maker Ltd. This collection contains shapefile boundaries for administrative divisions in Africa. The Map Library (www.maplibrary.org) is a project of the UK charity “The Map Maker Trust”. The Trust is founded on the belief that the lack of good, simple maps is a serious obstacle to development in all kinds of fields, from health care to urban management, from de-mining to environmental protection. The library's purpose is two fold: to make public domain mapping data more readily available for developing countries, and to provide free, easy to use software to facilitate map making by non-experts. System requirements: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software that reads ESRI shapefile format.",
