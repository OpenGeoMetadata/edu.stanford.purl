Temperature statistics (computed daily) from 2015 are matched to district boundaries from 2011. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for village level demographic analysis within basic applications to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. Coastal boundary aligned with imagery, no gaps in polygon, no topological errors, aggregate and % figures verified ML InfoMap. (2018). Monthly Mean Temperature, India, 2015. ML InfoMap.
