  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains the regional capitals within the Republic of Georgia. Population counts from the 1989 Soviet census are also included for each capital. In Georgia, a region is not a self-governing unit; its function is to coordinate communication of several municipalities (with the exception of the municipalities of Adjara and that of Tbilisi) with the central government of Georgia, which is represented in a region by an official appointed by Prime Minister, the State Commissioner. This layer is part of a collection of data relating to administrative units in the Republic of Georgia. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.
