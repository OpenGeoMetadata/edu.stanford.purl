  "dc_description_s": "Thiis polygon shapefile depicts field size in croplands of Kenya. These data were extracted from FAO's Africover dataset (2000). Throughout Kenyaâ€™s highlands, farmers tend to grow their crops in small fields. Sites where fields are large generally correspond to farming enterprises engaged in production of specific cash crops, such as wheat farming in Narok District or coffee growing in Kiambu and Thika Districts. Some of the large fields shown for Buret and Kericho Districts represent large fields of tea and tree plantations. Used in Map 5.7 of Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. (2000). Agricultural Fields: Kenya, 2000.
