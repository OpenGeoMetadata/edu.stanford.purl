East India Company, of the Bengal Provinces, and of the countries lying between them and Delhy; the whole exhibiting all the military roads and passes, as well as the most accurate division of the British possessions in the East Indies.

  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced image of a map of South Asia, including India and Pakistan, originally created by J. Rennell, T. Kitchen, R. Laurie, and J. Whittle in 1794, 2nd ed. 1804. The original map appears in '(A New Universal Atlas; Exhibiting all the Empires, Kingdoms, States, Republics, &amp;c. &amp;c. in the Whole World; Being a Complete Collection of the Most Approved Maps Extant; Corrected with the greatest care, and augmented from the last edition of D'Anville and Robert; [de Vaugondy] with many Improvements by Major James Rennel, and other eminent geographers, including all the tracks and new discoveries of the British Circumnavigators, Biron, Wallis, Carteret, Captain James Cook, Vancouver, Perouse, &amp;c. &amp;c. 6th Ed. ... London, R. Laurie &amp; J. Whittle, 1804.' The historic map layers in the Google Earth Rumsey Map Collection have been selected by David Rumsey from his large collection of historical maps, as well as some from other collections with which he collaborates. All the maps contain rich information about the past and represent a sampling of time periods, scales, and cartographic art, resulting in visual history stories that only old maps can tell. Each map has been georeferenced by Rumsey, thus creating unique digital map images that allow the old maps to appear in their correct places on the modern globe.  Some of the maps fit perfectly in their modern spaces, while othersgenerally earlier period mapsreveal interesting geographical misconceptions of their time.  Cultural features on the maps can be compared to the modern satellite views using the slider bars to adjust transparency. The result is an exploration of time as well as space, a marriage of historic cartographic masterpieces with innovative contemporary software tools.",
