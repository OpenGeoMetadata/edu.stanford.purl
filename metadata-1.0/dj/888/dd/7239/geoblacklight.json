  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents the major tributaries of the Russian River in California. Line features have attribute codes that represent streams or shorelines. This layer is also intended for users to display major tributaries on maps without seeing all existing tributaries in the Russian River watershed. The intended purpose of this dataset is to assist in watershed planning and analysis. This layer is also intended for users to display major tributaries on maps without seeing all existing tributaries in the Russian River watershed. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). Major Tributaries: Russian River, California, 1998-2002. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/dj888dd7239 The hydrography layer was assembled from data originally published by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Digital Line Graph (DLG-3) format. DLG-3 data were generated by USGS from 1:100,000-scale maps by manual digitizing and raster scanning. Approximately 3200 original USGS DLG files\nwere processed to create the statewide hydrography data layer.\n\nEdits to the original linework have been made during the data conversion from the original DLG-3 format to the ARC/INFO(tm) GIS format. Such changes include line movements (due to the map edge-matching process), minor corrections of attribute coding, and the closing of open polygons. Flow direction for streams (feature type line) has also been added. Stream arcs are flagged (where item FLOW = 1) to indicate whether or not the direction of a given stream (line) has been defined and/or verified.\n\nMajor Minor\nCode # Code # Element Description\n------ ------ -------------------\n50 200 Shoreline\n50 201 Man-made shoreline\n50 202 Closure line\n50 203 Indefinite shoreline\n50 204 Apparent Limit\n50 205 Outline of a Carolina bay\n50 206 Danger curve\n50 400 Rapids\n50 401 Falls\n50 402 Gravel pit/quarry filled w/water\n50 403 Gauging station\n50 404 Pumping station\n50 405 Water intake\n50 406 Dam or weir\n50 407 Canal lock or sluice gate\n50 408 Spillway\n50 409 Gate(flood,tidal,head,check)\n50 410 Rock\n50 411 Crevasse\n50 412 Stream\n50 413 Braided stream\n50 414 Ditch or canal\n50 415 Aqueduct\n50 416 Flume\n50 417 Penstock\n50 418 Siphon\n50 419 Channel in water area\n50 420 Wash or ephemeral drain\n50 421 Lake or pond\n50 422 Coral reef\n50 423 Sand in open water\n50 424 Spoil area\n50 425 Fish ladders\n50 601 Underground\n50 602 Overpassing\n50 603 Elevated\n50 604 Tunnel\n50 605 Right bank\n50 606 Left bank\n50 607 Under construction\n50 608 Salt\n50 609 Unsurveyed\n50 610 Intermittent\n50 611 Abandoned or discontinued\n50 612 Submerged or sunken\n50 613 Wooded\n50 614 Dry\n50 615 Mineral or hot ( sulphur, alkali, etc. )\n50 616 Navigable transportation\n50 617 Underpassing\n50 618 Earthen construction\n50 000 Photo-revised feature\n05N --- Water surface elevation, actual or\ninterpolated.\nN = elevation units\n1 = feet\n2 = meters\n6 = feet below datum\n7 = meters below datum\n\n053 --- Angle of clockwise rotation (nearest\nwhole degree)\n055 --- River mile, value in four spaces, right\njustified\n058 000 Best estimate of classification or\nposition\n059 0-- Coincident feature\" This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes.
