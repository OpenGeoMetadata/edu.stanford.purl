  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile of salmonid habitat data is summarized at the geomorphic reach level using the Rosgen classification of channel type. Data collected from in-stream salmonid habitat surveys were done or supervised by the California Department of Fish and Game from 1994 to 2001. This dataset is intended for salmonid habitat restoration planning at a scale between the habitat unit level and the entire tributary level, with a focus on the geomorphic reach. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). Stream Habitat Reach Summary: Russian River, California, 1994-2001. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/dp610gv4486 The underlying creek layer for most of the reaches is a 1:100,000 streams network originally derived from EPA Reach File 3 streams data, which is derived from USGS 1:100,000 streams data. No greater precision is intended. 2001 data reflect the precision of the new 1:24,000 streams layer available for the Russian River. Stream sinuosity is not well represented in a 1:100,000 streams layer, so location and shape of the stream course should be used carefully. In addition, many smaller streams are missing from this database. Some streams have been added to the existing streams layer by the people doing the dynamic segmentation (mostly Mike Byrne in the mid-1990s, now primarily Colin Brooks and Zeb Young). Many attributes are averaged at the reach level, meaning that values within a reach may be higher or lower than indicated. Also, they are based on a one-time sample and do not represent a time-series of data. In addition, the dynamic segmentation process does not place the data along the stream channel with absolute accuracy, so reaches may start or stop sooner or later than indicated. Some examples have been found where a change in reach type is 100 meters (about 328 feet) above or below its field-mapped location. Most reach locations are more accurately mapped, however. Data should be verified in the field when making final selections for projects in the field. Currently, streams surveyed and included in the GIS layer cover about 60% of the salmonid streams of the Russian River; 80% coverage is anticipated when all data (1994-2002) have been processed and included. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
