The information was extracted from a database of oil wells on the central coast created by the California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources. This layer is part of a collection describing Geology resources and constraints Monterey County, California. This database is useful for finding locations of active, inactive, and abandoned oil wells. It also lists the total well depth. Rosenberg, Lewis I. (2001).
