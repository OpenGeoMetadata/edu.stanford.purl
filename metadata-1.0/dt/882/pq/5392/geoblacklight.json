  "dc_description_s": "This digital raster graphic (DRG) is a composite raster image of two scanned 1974 USGS topographic maps including the collar information, georeferenced to the Calfornia State Plane grid. The DRG shows the area of Monterey County, California. This layer is part of a collection describing Geology resources and constraints Monterey County, California. A DRG is useful as a source or background layer in a GIS, as a means to perform quality assurance on other digital products, and as a source for the collection and revision of DLG data. DRG's can also be merged with other digital data, e.g. DEM's or DOQ's, to produce a hybrid digital file. Rosenberg, Lewis I. (2001). Digital Raster Graphic for Monterey County, California, 1974. Lew Rosenberg, Consulting Geologist, Templeton, Calif. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/dt882pq5392. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
