  "dc_description_s": "The Airport Runways database is a geographic dataset of runways in the United States and its Territories containing information on the physical characteristics of the runways. This polyline shapefile depicts 6,839 runways associated with the 19,527 airports in the companion airport dataset. This geospatial data is derived from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) National Airspace System Resource Aeronautical Data Product. This layer is part of the 2014 National Transportation Atlas Database. The National Transportation Atlas Databases 2014 (NTAD2014) is a set of nationwide geographic datasets of transportation facilities, transportation networks, associated infrastructure and other political and administrative entities. These datasets include spatial information for transportation modal networks and intermodal terminals, as well as the reÂ¬lated attribute information for these features. This data supports research, analysis, and decision-making across all transportation modes. It is most useful at the national level, but has major applications at regional, state and local scales throughout the transportation community. The data used to compile NTAD2014 was provided by our partners within the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and by other agencies throughout the United States Federal Government. These contributors are the actual data stewards and are ultimately responsible for the maintenance and accuracy of their data. The data provides users with information about airport runway locations for national and regional analysis applications. United States. Department of Transportation.
