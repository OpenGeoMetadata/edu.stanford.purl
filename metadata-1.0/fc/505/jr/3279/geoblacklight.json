  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile shows the basin boundaries of the Churu Watershed in India for 2012. Churu is a district of the Indian state of Rajasthan in western India. This layer is part of the Watershed Map of India which includes information about drainage networks (i.e. major rivers, streams and large reservoirs.) Also includes data on catchment areas/watersheds boundaries, basins and sub-basins. These data are intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.
