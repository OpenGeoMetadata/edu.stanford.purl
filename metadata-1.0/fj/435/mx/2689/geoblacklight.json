  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents wildlife density in Kenya's rangelands for 1994-96. This data was used in Map 1.4, Map 4.10, and Map 5.11 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being. International Livestock Research Institute. (2007). Wildlife Density in Rangelands of Kenya, 1994-1996. World Resources Institute. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/fj435mx2689 Species numbers are aggregated using a \"tropical livestock unit\" (TLU) (which is equivalent to an animal weight of 250 kilograms) to grid cells of 5x5 km and then averaged by square kilometer. The wildlife counts include 21 different large grazing animals that can be observed during low-altitude flights in Kenya. Units are in \"tropical livestock unit per sq. kilometer.\" Note: A livestock density nul should be interpreted as \"No observation of animals\". Please refer to DRSRS for updates.
