  "dc_description_s": "The Global Exposure database for GAR 2015 (GEG‐2015) is an open exposure global dataset which integrates population and country‐specific building typology, use and value. The purpose of GEG 2015 is to give an order of magnitude of the potential economic value of exposed assets, in the perspective of a comparison between countries. This approach offers the considerable advantage of ensuring good uniformity and ability to compare results across the different countries, together with the relative availability of the base datasets necessary in order to build the model. On the other hand, however, the results remain highly correlated with population, because strictly dependent on it.",
