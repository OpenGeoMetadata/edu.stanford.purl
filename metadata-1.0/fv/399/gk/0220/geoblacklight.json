  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains locations of 4G mobile cellular towers around the world for 2013. The data is created from submissions made directly to Collins Bartholomew or the GSMA from mobile operators, which provide roaming detail for inclusion in the online mapping application known as Collins Mobile Coverage Web. The data is supplied with a nominal resolution of approximately 1km on the ground. This map can be used to locate and analyze mobile communications coverage on a global scale. Collins Bartholomew Ltd. (2014). Global 4G Cellular Towers, 2013.  Collins Bartholomew Ltd. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/fv399gk0220 Operators are asked to submit strong (>= -92dBm) and variable (>= -100dBm and < 92dBm) signal strengths as part of their submissions. The data here includes both types but does not make a distinction between the two. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
