Original data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration biogeographic regional assessment of the National Marine Sanctuaries. Additional data provided and modifications made by each regional SAT in respective regions. This dataset provides coverage for land habitat that is used for periods of rest, molting and nesting by sea bird colonies, such as pelicans, gulls and terns. This coverage originally developed for use in the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) Science Advisory Team (SAT) evaluation and cartographic representaton of bird colony size and location.
