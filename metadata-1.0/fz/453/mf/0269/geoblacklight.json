There are 25 categories of data which include information about farms, crops, livestock, values of products, and farm operator characteristics. The data is for the United States and is presented by county. This is a replacement for the June 2005 Agriculture Census of the United States 2002 map layer. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.
