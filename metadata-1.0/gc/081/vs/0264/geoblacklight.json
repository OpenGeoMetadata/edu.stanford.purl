This coverage was created from data extracted from the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) \"TerrainBase\" dataset. The TerrainBase global digital terrain model contains a complete matrix of land elevation and ocean depth values for the entire world. NGDC/WDC-A developed the model using the best public domain data available at the time of publication. The intended use of calbath5 is as a companion dataset to the Department of Fish and Game \"Trawl logbook catch grid\", developed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council, the States of Washington, Oregon, and California, and the National Marine Fisheries Service (see coverage \"caltrawl\"). The coarse resolution of the estimated depths facilitates rapid display on microcomputer and comparative analysis of trawl block data. This coverage is not suitable for inshore habitat analysis nor for navigation. PROCESSING STEPS 1. Internet accessed NOAA/NGDC site: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/seltopo.html 2. Entered min/max decimal degree lat/long values for coverage caltrawl, plus a 0.1 degree buffer. 3. Selected output options: TerrainBase, ascii,lon/lat/datavalue, comma-delimited, Least Sig.Byte 1st. 4. In ARCVIEW, added comma-delimited table and created a new event theme. 5. Converted event theme to shapefile. 6. Extracted points within extent of coverage \"caltrawl\", plus manually extended buffer. Re-converted to a new shapefile. 7. Edited attributes, added meters, feet, fathom units. Constants: 1 meter = 3.2808 feet; 1 fathom = 6 feet. 8. Removed grid anomolies where offshore values had non-negative data values, i.e. where ocean points had elevations greater than zero. 9. Ran spatial join, adding item BLOCK10_ID from coverage \"caltrawl\". 10.In ARC/INFO ran shapearc to convert shapefile to a coverage. 11.Reprojected decimal degree coverage to Teale albers, using default datum.

Due to misalignment of grids, instances of BLOCK10-ID in this coverage are only appoximate. DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT: A term to describe the type of height values represented in the model (such as mean, mode, point, etc.) cannot be assigned to the TerrainBase model since it is comprised of a variety of source data. The type of terrain height represented by these source data sets varies from one model to the next. For example, the FNOC model has modal heights, while the USA model uses point heights, and the Europe model has mean heights. Consequently, it is not possible to assign a single term to represent all of the height values given in the TerrainBase model. To satisfy interested users, however, a term that can be used which is common to all of the source data is best estimate of height. That is, the data represent the best estimate of height for each 5-minute cell. Although such a term has minimal scientific value, it does emphasize the fact that the data only represent reasonable estimates of the height of the terrain (NOAA/NGDC 1997).
