  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains the 5th level, 10 digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) watershed boundaries in California. This layer consists of georeferenced digital data and associated attributes created in accordance with the \"USGS National Map Accuracy Standards and the NRCS Federal Standards for Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries, 10/01/04.\" These data were developed by digitizing watershed and subwatershed boundary lines using 1:24,000-scale digital raster graphics (DRG), high-resolution digital watershed datasets, a high-resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) at 1:24,000-scale, and 1:250,000-scale draft hydrologic boundary lines. A 30-meter National Elevation Dataset (NED) was used to produce the 1:250,000-scale preliminary draft boundaries, as well as a hillshade layer for additional reference. Some draft catchments (watersheds/subwatersheds) were also created with Watershed Boundary Dataset tools (ArcHydro Tools, Version 9), using the NED for terrain analysis and the NHD for determining stream flow direction. Polygons are attributed with the following: hydrologic unit codes for 5th level watersheds; HU sizes (in acres); states containing the HUs; non-contributing areas; downsteam hydrologic units; 5th and 6th level names; type of HUs (standard, frontal, etc.); flow modifications; and Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) identification numbers. This layer is part of the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD): a complete 1:24,000 scale digital hydrologic unit (HU) boundary layer for the 4th level subbasin (8 digit), the 5th level watershed (10 digit), and the 6th level (12-digit) subwatershed for the state of California. The watershed hydrologic unit boundaries provide a uniquely identified and uniform method of subdividing large drainage areas. This layer is intended to be used as a tool for water resource management and planning activities, particularly for site-specific and localized studies requiring a level of detail provided by large-scale map information. These data are part of a larger, seamless, nationally consistent geospatial database for the watershed boundary dataset. Wyoming Geographic Information Sciences Center. (2013). Watershed Boundaries, California (10-digit HUC), 2000-2008. Wyoming Geographic Information Sciences Center. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/gg725wn2951. The definition for a hydrologic unit according to the FGDC Proposal, Version 1.0 - Federal Standards For Delineation of \nHydrologic Unit Boundaries 3/01/02 states “A hydrologic unit is a drainage area delineated to nest in a multi-level, \nhierarchical drainage system.  Its boundaries are defined by hydrographic and topographic criteria that delineate an \narea of land upstream from a specific point on a river, stream or similar surface waters.  A hydrologic unit can accept \nsurface water directly from upstream drainage areas, and indirectly from associated surface areas such as remnant, \nnon-contributing, and diversions to form a drainage area with single or multiple outlet points. Hydrologic units are \nonly synonymous with classic watersheds when their boundaries include all the source area contributing surface water to a \nsingle defined outlet point. “ This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes.
