There are three designation categories: nonattainment, unclassifiable and attainment areas. Non-attainment areas are those which are in violation of the standard. Nonattainment areas have various classifications. Each designation and classification area has an associated date field that represents the \"effective\" date of the action as published in 40CFR81.305. This data layer is current as of November 2003. Projection: Teale Albers, NAD83 Designation areas are defined purThis shapefile can be used to identify designation areas that are defined pursuant to the corresponding federal national ambient air quality standard for inhalable coarse particles (PM 10) as per the Clean Air Act.suant to the corresponding federal national ambient air quality standard for each pollutant as per the Clean Air Act.
