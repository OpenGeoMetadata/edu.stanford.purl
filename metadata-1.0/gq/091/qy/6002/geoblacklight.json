  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents administrative divisions in Mongolia. The Global Map Mongolia version 2 was developed to update Global Map Mongolia version 1 based on Global Map Specifications version 2.1. The data source for update was the 1:100,000 Boundary data made between 2007 and 2010. Water Course feature was updated using ALOS imagery of Ulaanbaatar area. The population attribute was newly acquired using 1:100,000 paper maps which were used to develop Global Map Mongolia version 1.

The data have been authorized by NGIAs of respective countries and regions. Therefore, the contents of respective data are based on the views of respective data developers. For some countries and regions, there may be parts where data have not been developed. National/Regional version of Global Map data was to be updated in about five-year cycle on the basis of resolutions of an ISCGM meeting. To know about the year data were updated and about data developers, please refer to metadata attached to each data. Depending on the period the data were prepared, they were developed in line with two different specifications, namely, version 1 in VPF and BIL formats, and version 2 in GML and BIL formats.
