  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: 'A delineation of the strata of England and Wales, with part of Scotland : exhibiting the collieries and mines, the marshes and fen lands originally overflowed by the sea, and the varieties of soil according to the variations in the substrata, illustrated by the most descriptive names.' The original map was created by William Smith in 1815, at a scale of 5 miles to one inch.Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change. As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.",
