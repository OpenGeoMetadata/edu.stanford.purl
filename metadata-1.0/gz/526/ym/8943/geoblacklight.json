  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile contains tilted photovoltaic solar power resource levels of watt hours per meter squared (Wh/m2) in the contiguous United States using 50-meter interval contour lines. Tilted photovoltaic panels are those that are angled in order to maximize exposure to direct sunlight. Tilt angles are often equal to the site's latitude but may vary throughout the year. This layer is a part of a collection of GIS data containing renewable and electric energy information for the U.S., including data on transmission lines, power plants and electricity substations. This layer can be used for estimates of solar resource potential. Hart Energy Publishing. (2015). Photovoltaic Power (Horizontal) Contour Lines, 50-Meter Intervals: United States, 1998-2005. Hart Energy Publishing. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/gz526ym8943 This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of 0.1 degrees in both latitude and longitude, or about 10 km in size. This data was developed using the State University of New York/Albany satellite radiation model. This model was developed by Dr. Richard Perez and collaborators at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and other universities for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Perez, et al. (2002). This model uses hourly radiance images from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. A modified Bird model is used to calculate clear sky direct normal (DNI). This is then adjusted as a function of the ratio of clear sky global horizontal (GHI) and the model predicted GHI. Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalable at a 10km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 15% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other microclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
