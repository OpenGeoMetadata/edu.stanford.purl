  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains GAP analysis data for land ownership and management in areas within the Russian River Basin of California. This layer distinguishes local, state,and federal jurisdictions from private lands and delineates areas managed for the long-term maintenance of natural ecological processes and biodiversity. This layer therefore contains attributes both for ownership and for the level of biodiversity protection. This layer can be used for watershed analysis and planning in the Russian River region of California. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). GAP Analysis: Russian River Basin, California, 1975-1994. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/hk639jr2136 This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes.
