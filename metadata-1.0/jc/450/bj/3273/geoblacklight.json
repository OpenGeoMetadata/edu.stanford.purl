  "dc_description_s": "The Bahamas Area of Interest (AOI) for InVEST Coastal Vulnerability Model was used for the analysis in Silver JM, Arkema KK, Griffin RM, Lashley B, Lemay M, Maldonado S, Moultrie SH, Ruckelshaus M, Schill S, Thomas A, Wyatt K and Verutes G (2019) Advancing Coastal Risk Reduction Science and Implementation by Accounting for Climate, Ecosystems, and People. Frontiers in Marine Science 6:556. doi: 10.3389/fmars.2019.00556.  The boundary was delineated to include all the land areas of The Bahamas and surrounding waters to include the shallow waters, marine habitats, and continental shelf zone.   There are no relevant attributes, just a single geospatial polygon. The AOI delineates the spatial extent used to run the InVest Coastal Vulnerability model for the 2019 Bahamas Coastal Hazard Analysis This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.
