The three urban area boundaries were merged and smoothed to create the 170 adjusted urban area boundaries for California. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). The 2010 adjusted urban area file represents the current Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approved Caltrans adjusted urban area boundaries in California. California Department of Transportation.
