  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents coral reefs on the eastern coast of Kenya. These data were acquired from 'KenSea, Environmental Sensitivity Atlas for Coastal Area of Kenya,' published by the Geological Survey of Denmark (GEUS) (2006). To protect the ecological integrity of Kenya’s coral reefs, the government has designated six marine reserves — Kisite, Kiunga, Malindi, Mombasa, Mpunguti, and Watamu — encompassing a signiﬁcant portion of the reef and its surrounding waters. This data was used in Map 6.4 and Map 6.5 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being. Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, and the United Nations Development Programme of Kenya. (2006). Coral Reefs on Eastern Coast of Kenya, 2006. GEUS. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/kb118sw6233 The full report is available at http://www.geus.dk/program-areas/nature-environment/international/reports/kensea/kensea_rapport.pdf.
