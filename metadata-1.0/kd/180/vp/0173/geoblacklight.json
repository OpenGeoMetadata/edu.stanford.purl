  "dc_description_s": "This polyline shapefile depicts bathymetric contour line coverage for California that generally covers the continental shelf at 50 foot contour resolution. The contours were developed by interpolating National Ocean Service (NOS) Hydrographic Survey depth points. The TopoGrid algorithm within ArcInfo software was the primary gridding interpolation procedure, followed by a standard contouring routine. The contours are one possible interpretation based on chosen contouring procedures. The purpose of this contour map is to visualize changes in ocean depths relative to sea level in the nearshore California continental shelf, which is the portion of the continent beneath the oceanâ€™s surface. The bathymetric measurements used here refer to the study of water depths only and do not include the underwater, or submarine, topography of the ocean floor except as it relates to water depths. These data are not suitable for navigation purposes. California Department of Fish and Wildlife. (2001). 50-Foot Bathymetric Contours: California, Continental Shelf, 2000. Marine Region GIS Lab.

Supplemental_Information: Converted to California Teale Albers NAD83 by the California Department of Fish and Game -- BEGIN ORIGINAL METADATA - THIS INFORMATION MAY NOT BE CURRENT -- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME (DFG) GIS METADATA California Nearshore Contour Bathymetry - 50 foot contours DRAFT Version produced by Teale Data Center GIS Solutions Group COVERAGE NAME: nbath50f METADATA FILE: nbath50f.txt METADATA DATE: 1999.12.09 COVERAGE DESCRIPTION: Nbath50f is a bathymetric contour line coverage for California that generally covers the continental shelf at 50 foot contour resolution. The data is in DRAFT form, subsequent to later revisions by the Teale Data Center GIS Solutions Group and the DFG GIS program. The contours were developed by interpolating National Ocean Service (NOS) Hydrographic Survey depth points. The TopoGrid algorithm within ArcInfo software was the primary gridding interpolation procedure, followed by a standard contouring routine. More details will be provided when a final version is complete. The coverage is not suitable for navigation. The contours are one possible interpretation based on chosen contouring procedures. The Teale Data Center and the California Department of Fish and Game make no warranty as to the suitability of this data for any purpose. VITAL STATISTICS: Standard Teale Parameters?
