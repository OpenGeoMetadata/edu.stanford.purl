  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile describes the the extent of riparian vegetation in alluvial areas of selected Sonoma County, Russian River tributaries in 2000. Russian River tributaries include: Barrelli Creek, Big Sulphur Creek, Brooks Creek, Crocker Creek, Dry Creek, Gill Creek, Hobson Creek, Hoot Owl Creek, Icaria Creek, Lytton Creek, Maacama Creek, Mark West Creek, Miller Creek and Sausal Creek. Feature boundaries were interpreted from digital aerial orthophotography and raster digital USGS topographic maps. This layer can be used for land use analysis and planning in the Russian River region of California. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). Riparian Vegetation: Alluvial Areas of Russian River Tributaries, Sonoma County, California, 2000. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/kf123sg8914 The shapefile was created by heads-up digitizing using County of Sonoma, Information Systems Department, digital orthophotography (compressed SID Imagery) that has \"been corrected to the ground using aerial and ground-based global positioning system (GPS) survey coordinates.\n\nThe image data are currently being quality checked by County staff and may contain irregularities. The data are “mosaicked” together into 10 separate delivery areas and the resolution of the data varies by delivery area: One-foot resolution or better in urban or incorporated areas and two-foot resolution in forested, mountainous, or other unincorporated areas of the County\" (County of Sonoma, Information Systems Department, Data Request). This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
