  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents existing and planned electric transmission lines through 2022 in the New England coastal region (United States). A transmission line is a structure that forms a path for directing the transmission of electric power. When interconnected with each other, transmission lines become transmission networks typically referred to as \"power grids\". This data depicts transmission lines existing in the New England area (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont). These lines are all connected to substations (facilities that switch, change, and/or regulate electric voltage) using points of the New England Substations layer. Substations transform voltage from high to low, or the reverse, or perform any of several other important functions. Between the generating station and consumer, electric power may flow through several substations at different voltage levels. To support coastal and ocean planning and other activities pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act, Energy Policy Act, Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Rivers and Harbors Act and the Submerged Lands Act.
