Attributes include county and state names as well as FIPS identification numbers and county area estimates. Territories enumerated by the U.S. Census are also included. This layer is part of a collection of historical United States county boundary files (HUSCO), from each decade ranging from 1790-1999. This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.
