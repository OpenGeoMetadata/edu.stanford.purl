  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts Census tracts as of 2000 for the County of Santa Cruz, California. Census Tract and Block numbers can be linked to Population and Housing information collected by the United States Census each decade. Population information available includes: sex, race, age, ethnic background, income, education, language spoken at home, employment and more. Housing information includes: number of units and rooms in structure, ownership, home value, rent, source of water, condominium, year built and more. Census Tracts are identified by a 4 digit basic number and may have a 2 digit suffix. For example, 6059.02. Census Tract numbers range from 0001 through 9499.99 and are unique within a county (numbers in the range of 9501 through 9989.99 denote a Block numbering area). Census Tracts represent the smallest territorial unit for which population data are available in many countries. In the United States, Census Tracts are subdivided into Block Groups and Census Blocks. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California.

County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. (2001). Census Tracts: Santa Cruz County, California, 2000. Santa Cruz County, California. Available at http://purl.stanford.edu/kq582fy8743. GIS Layer Number = 7Y/ Digital information was received from the U.S. Census Bureau which identified physical features, existing district boundaries and other source information in our county. Original 1990 Census Tract lines were used in areas which had not changed. Physical features included such things as road centerlines, railroads and streams. These data were compiled from many different sources; therefore, the accuracy of the individual layers varies significantly, and some layers do not align exactly with others. In the urban areas, data are generally accurate within five to ten feet of their true geographic coordinates, but in the rural areas, data may be accurate to only within three hundred feet. With these limitations, the County of Santa Cruz disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy or correctness of this data. This disclaimer is exclusive and in lieu of any warranties, fitness for particular purpose, and/or any other type of warranty, whether expressed or implied. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
