  "dc_description_s": "The polygon shapefile contains the boundaries of 515 groundwater basins and subbasins as defined by the California Department of Water Resources (Bulletin 118, 2003). Groundwater basins are represented as polygon features and designated on the basis of geological and hydrological conditions - usually the occurrence of alluvial or unconsolidated deposits. When practical, large basins are also subdivided by political boundaries, as in the Central Valley. Basins are named and numbered per the convention of the Department of Water Resources. The associated data are considered DWR enterprise GIS data, which meet all appropriate requirements of the DWR GIS Spatial Data Standards. DWR makes no warranties or guarantees, either expressed or implied, as to the completeness, accuracy or correctness of the data, nor accepts or assumes any liability arising from or for any incorrect, incomplete or misleading subject data. Bulletin 118 defines the recognized groundwater basins and subbasins throughout the State of California. The Bulletin 118 document provides information on these basins/subbasins and the nature and extent of groundwater occurrence and management within the State. The Bulletin 118 dataset makes the geographic locations and extent of the 515 basins/subbasins publically available, for use in external mapping/GIS applications. Horizontal positional accuracy was established by professional judgement. According to Bill Brewster, 100% of the linework is better than 10 mile accuracy. Some places are better than 10 mile accuracy. California Department of Water Resources. (2015). Bulletin 118 - Groundwater Basins and Subbasins, California, 2003. California Department of Water Resources. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/kt110sd4399. Origination of Data - The basin boundaries for the groundwater basin map were primarily defined using geologic contacts and hydrogeologic divides. Specifically, the identification of the groundwater basins was initially based on the presence and areal extent of unconsolidated alluvial soils identified on 1:250,000 scale geologic maps provided by the California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology. The identified groundwater basin areas were then further evaluated through review of relevant geologic and hydrogeologic reports, well completion reports, court-determined adjudicated basin boundaries, and contact with local agencies to refine the basin boundaries. Date - The latest version of DWRâ€™s Bulletin 118 document is dated October, 2003, and is available at: http://www.water.ca.gov/groundwater/bulletin118/update2003.cfm The current dataset was updated at the time the latest Bulletin 118 document was produced, and is based on geological maps and other information available at that time. There have been minor corrections to the dataset since that time, as described in the data lineage.

Minor changes are occasionally made and will be documented in the metadata. Substantial changes, such as the extent of a basin boundary, must be completed as part of a public process, where the changes are proposed and public review and comment are welcomed before any changes are finalized.
