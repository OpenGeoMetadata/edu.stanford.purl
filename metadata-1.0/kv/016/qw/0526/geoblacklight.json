This hillshade was generated by GreenInfo Network and was created from a 150m USGS DEM using the hillshade feature in spatial analyst. This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project and contributed to the developement of the Conservation Lands Network.
