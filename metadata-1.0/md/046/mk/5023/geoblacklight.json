  "dc_description_s": "The Nighttime Lights of the World dataset contains the first satellite-based global inventory of human settlements, derived from nighttime data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS). The DMSP-OLS has the unique capability to observe faint sources of visible-near infrared emissions present at the Earth's surface, including cities, towns, villages, gas flares, and fires. NGDC has developed algorithms for producing georeferenced fire and nighttime lights prod System requirements: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software that reads ESRI shapefile format.",
