  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile portrays milk production per square kilometer in central and western Kenya, 1997. Calculations of milk production were done by assessing the number of dairy cattle in an administrative area, and extrapolating out liters of milk per area. This data was used in Map 4.5 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being. Baltenweck I., Staal, L. Njoroge, F. Wanyoike, Ochungo, P., Kariuki, E and International Livestock Research Institute. (2005). Milk Production in Central and Western Kenya, 2005. ILRI.
