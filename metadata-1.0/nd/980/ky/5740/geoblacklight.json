  "dc_description_s": "To measure and report forest soil organic carbon for mineral soils, inventory compilers using Tier 1 approaches will need to determine climate and soil type based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guidelines (https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol4.html). This map layer will allow users to determine these climate-soil types for any forested area globally. Created using data from the International Soil Reference Information Centre (https://www.isric.org/sites/default/files/isric_report_2009_02.pdf) as well as the European Commission Joint Research Centre Institute for Environment and Sustainability (https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/RenewableEnergy/).
