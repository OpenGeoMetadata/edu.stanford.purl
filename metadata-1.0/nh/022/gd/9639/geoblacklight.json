  "dc_description_s": "This raster layer is a georeferenced image containing tree canopy data for the conterminous United States, in an Albers Equal-Area Conic projection and at a resolution of 100 meters. The tree canopy data were derived from the 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) Percent Tree Canopy data set, a product of the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC). The MRLC is a multi-agency cooperative effort to study land cover change. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States. The 100-meter resolution tree canopy data were developed to portray the tree canopy of the United States at 1:1,000,000 scale. They are intended primarily for visual purposes. The original NLCD data should be used for conducting scientific analysis. U.S. Geological Survey. (2013). 100-Meter Resolution Tree Canopy of the Conterminous United States, 2001. USGS. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/nh022gd9639. NLCD data sets at 30-meter resolution may be downloaded from the MRLC Web site, http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd01_data.php. Further information on NLCD, related data sets, and land cover research may be found at the online USGS Land Cover Institute http://landcover.usgs.gov/. Pixel values for tree canopy data and their corresponding RGB colors are listed in the color ramp (.clr) file that accompanies the data set. This table shows all tree canopy classes and the RGB color values used to represent them. &gt;Pixel value NLCD 2001 Tree Canopy classes R G B &gt;================================================================================== &gt;1 through 100 Percent tree canopy, 1% through 100% See .clr for RGB's &gt;101, 102, 103 Non-U.S. land 240 235 211 &gt;104 Background U.S. land 104 104 104 &gt;0 Ocean water 193 224 250 Pixel values 1 through 100 represent the percentage covered by tree canopy, as seen from above. Pixel value 101 represents land in Canada or the British Virgin Islands. Pixel value 102 represents land in Mexico or Russia. Pixel value 103 represents land in The Bahamas and Cuba in the southeastern part of the data set. Pixel value 104 represents U.S. land that does not have valid data values. There are no null values in the image. Included with the GeoTIFF are an auxiliary information file (.aux.xml), an image overview file (.ovr), a value attribute database file (.vat.dbf), a .tfw file (more information included below), a .prj file (more information included below), and an Adobe Color Table (.act) file.
