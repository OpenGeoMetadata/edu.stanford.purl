  "dc_description_s": " The Nolli map consists of twelve exquisitely engraved copper plates that measure approximately six feet high and seven feet wide when combined (176 cm by 208 cm). The map includes almost eight square miles of the densely-built 18th century city as well as the surrounding terrain. It also identifies 1,320 numbered sites clearly marked on the map and linked to a separate legend printed by Nolli to accompany the map. Several hundred additional sites and textual notes describe palazzi, ville, gardens and other built and landscape features resulting in nearly two thousand sites of cultural significance. Nolli’s map is an extraordinary technical achievement that represents a milestone in the art and science of cartography.The version of the map provided here is a digital remastering of the original 12 plates with the seams joining each plate carefully removed. The re-mastered version was created originally in 2004 by James Tice, Erik Steiner and Mark Brenneman with the assistance of Allan Ceen who provided detailed annotations for all 1320 sites noted by Nolli in its legend. The map was geo-referenced—brought into real geographic space—in 2014 by Erik Steiner, Giovanni Svevo and James Tice making it commensurate with state-of-the-art GIS protocols. The Pianta Grande has been used by our team and others as a base for delineating other historic maps of Rome which have become part of its enduring legacy. These include, especially, our ongoing effort to digitally remaster the enormous Forma Urbis Romaeby Rodolfo Lanciani of 1901, a layered map of Rome which features an in-depth archeological account of the city using Nolli's map as a foundational layer.
