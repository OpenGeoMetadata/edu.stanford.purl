  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset is a 1-meter resolution digital elevation model (DEM) containing multibeam bathymetry data for the Elkhorn Slough region of Monterey Bay, California. The survey for Elkhorn Slough was conducted 8/12/2005 - 8/15/2005. Elkhorn Slough, one of the largest remaining coastal wetlands in California, has been directly subjected to tidal scour since the opening of Moss Landing Harbor in 1946. This erosion endangers the habitat of several rare and endangered species and disrupts the wetland ecosystem as a whole. In 2003, the Seafloor Mapping Lab of California State University, Monterey Bay created the most detailed bathymetry model of the Slough to date using a combination of multi-beam sonar, single-beam sonar and aerial photography. This layer was created as part of the California Seafloor Mapping Project. This project was conducted to determine changes in the pattern of erosion and deposition in Elkhorn Slough since surveys conducted in 1993, 2001 and 2003. Adjustments were made to the previously released 1m bathymetry grids to account for a 35cm data shift Seafloor Mapping Lab (2010). 1-Meter Bathymetric Digital Elevation Model: Elkhorn Slough, California, 2005. Seafloor Mapping Lab. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/np727vv0751 Bathymetric and backscatter (sidescan) data were collected aboard the R/V VenTresca using a Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder. Prior to data collection a series of survey lines were created using Hypack Max GOLD from Coastal Oceanographics. An Applanix POS/MV was used to position the vessel during data collection and accounted for vessel motion such as heave, pitch, and roll (position accuracy ± 2m, pitch, roll and heading accuracy ±0.02°, heave accuracy ± 5% or 5cm). NobelTec Tides and Currents software provided NOAA predicted tides to account for tide cycle fluctuations and sound velocity profiles were collected with an Applied Microsystems SVPlus sound velocimeter.\n\nBathymetry products are presented according to standard California State Mapping Project specifications, including depth-dependent resolutions of 2m for data from the 0-85m depth range, 5m for 80-250m depth range, and 10m for depths of 230-1500m. A comprehensive 5m data set was produced for the total survey coverage only if per block data exceeded 85m depth and 5m resolution products were included. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
