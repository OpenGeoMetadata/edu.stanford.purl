  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents hydrographic point features such as springs and wells. The point features were selected based on their spatial location within the extent of the Russian River basin. The data was captured from 1 to 100,000 scale maps. This dataset is intended mapping the flowing waters of the Russian River basin as well as an aid to watershed analysis and planning. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). Hydrographic Point Features: Russian River Basin, California, 1998-2002. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/ny938ct8247 Data derived from USGS (U.S. Geological Survey) DLG-3 (Digital Line Graphs) optional data format. Data was captured by manual digitizing, raster scanning, and editing systems. There are approximately 3200 DLG files making up the statewide area. This layer consists of all wells, springs, cisterns, etc., and is stored in counties and statewide files. The layer is composed of Arc/INFO point features only. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
