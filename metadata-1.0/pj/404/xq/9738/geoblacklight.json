  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile shows contour coverage of Monterey Bay at 200-meter intervals. These data were created from the 20-Meter Bathymetry Grid (bathy20m) using the spatial analyst. Shapefiles for this layer are available in WGS84 and UTM Zone 10 (NAD83) projections. This layer is part of the GIS Data of the Monterey Bay collection, a compilation of data and imagery of the Monterey Bay area, including coastline, imagery, and bathymetry. These data were created as a vector representation of a raster-based bathymetry surface. This collection of data provides documented layers of of the Monterey Bay to persons/institutions of interest throughout the research and educational communities. Hatcher, G.
