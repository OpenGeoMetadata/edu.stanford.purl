  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts centroid locations for populated places in the County of Solano, California, including cities, communities and historic places. The source data for this layer is Teale Data Center's California specific extraction of the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) datafiles. These features are compiled mainly from USGS map products, such as the 7.5 foot 1:24,000 quads. Modifications were made to the source data to suit the intended purpose of the layer. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data produced by Solano County, California. Solano Regional Geographic Information Systems Consortium (Solano ReGIS) is a cooperative of local government agencies within Solano County, California, working together to share spatial data, pool resources, and provide GIS expertise to Solano ReGIS members, which include the Cities of Benicia, Dixon, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun City, Vacaville and Vallejo; the County of Solano; the Fairfield-Suisun Sewer District; the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO); the Solano County Water Agency; the Solano Irrigation District; the Solano Transportation Authority; and the Vallejo Sanitation and Flood Control District. These Solano ReGIS members provide public access to applications, maps and spatial data. Solano County encompasses 7 cities and approximately 425,000 people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.
