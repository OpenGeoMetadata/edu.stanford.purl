  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of a map of the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the West India Islands, with portions of Venezuela and Granada. The original map was created and published by J.M. Atwood in 1851. The map shows the Gold Regions of California as well as routes over land and by Isthmus to California and Oregon. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. A scanned veriosn of this map was georeferenced by the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) at Stanford University. This map is part of a selection of georeferenced historic maps from the David Rumsey Map Collection at Stanford University.This layer provides an historical perspective of the cultural and physical landscape during this time period. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography. As this map has been georeferenced, it also can be used as a background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.\n    ",
