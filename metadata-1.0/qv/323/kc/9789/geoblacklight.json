Data are available for maximum temperature (maxT), minimum temperature (minT), and mean temperature (meanT). GRD and ASCII files are provided for each year from 1951 to 2016. The unit of temperature is in Celsius. Gridded data for the year 2008 and onwards are based on relatively less number of stations (around 180) for which data were received operationally on real time basis.",
