  "dc_description_s": "This raster layer is a georeferenced image of a map originally created by Carington Bowles in 1783. The scanned map file was georectified for use in the web application, Authorial London. Authorial London is a literary geography, mapping references to places within London found in literary works by writers who lived in London for an extended period. Place references can be searched and browsed by multiple dimensions, including author, genre, literary form, and neighborhood. This historic paper map provides an historical perspective of the cultural and physical landscape during this time period. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography. As this map has been georeferenced, it also can be used as a background layer in conjunction with other GIS data. The horizontal positional accuracy of a raster image is approximately the same as the accuracy of the published source map. The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document.  There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 221.645 meters. This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
