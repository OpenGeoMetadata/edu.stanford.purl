  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset was derived from the 30 meter resolution Digital Elevation Model layer and depicts percent slope across the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California. Slope is useful in a variety of analyses, including watershed integrity and identifying rugged terrain that is less susceptible to development. This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
