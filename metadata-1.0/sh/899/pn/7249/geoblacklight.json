  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a digital raster graphic (DRG) of a scanned nautical chart titled Senja to Risøysundet. It was published by the Defense Mapping Agency, 5th Ed., February 1997. Scale 1:50000. Covers west coast of Norway from Senja to Risøysundet including Kvæfjorden. Map includes inset titled Continuation of Kvæfjorden [Scale 1:100,00]. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced maps from The Branner Library Map Collection at Stanford University. Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change. As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
