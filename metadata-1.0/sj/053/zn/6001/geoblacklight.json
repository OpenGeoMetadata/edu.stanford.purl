This data layer represents the extracted (EXT) output of the dbSEABED mining software. It contains data items which were simply extracted from the data resources through data mining. The EXT data is usually based on instrumental analyses (probe or laboratory) but may apply to just a subsample of the sediment (eg. no large shells).
