  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains results from Fyke net monitoring of salmonid passage that was conducted to evaluate the potential effects of reclaimed water discharged to Santa Rosa Creek by the Santa Rosa Subregional Reclamation System. Three Russian River tributaries, including two target streams and one control (Maacama Creek), were monitored over five migration seasons (1990-1995). Fyke nets fished in upstream and downstream directions. Data collected includes information for steelhead, coho and chinook adults and juveniles. The study period included both normal and unusually dry rainfall seasons. This shapefile provides data on salmonid behavior and physical characteristics during the migration season (October - April). Fyke netting is only effective during low to moderate stream flow periods so data should not be used as annual salmonid populations estimates. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). Fyke Net Monitoring of Salmonid Passages: Russian River, California, 1990-1995. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/tj621rb1191 Data for total salmonids caught per day (rr_day) was only available for the 1993/94 and 1994/95 monitoring years. Separate summaries were prepared for each species, lifestage and travel direction (upstream or downstream). This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
