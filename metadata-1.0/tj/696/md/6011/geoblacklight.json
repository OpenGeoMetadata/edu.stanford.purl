  "dc_description_s": "This raster layer contains monthly and annual average solar irradiation resource potential for the continental United States averaged over surface cells of 0.1 degrees in both latitude and longitude (about 10 km in size). This layer is a part of a collection of GIS data containing renewable and electric energy information for the U.S., including data on transmission lines, power plants and electricity substations. This raster dataset provides information on the solar resource potential for the continental United States. The insolation values represent the average solar energy available to a concentrating collector on a 2-axis tracker, such as a dish or a power tower. Hart Energy Publishing. (2015). Solar Tower and Dish Power Grid, United States, 1998-2005. Hart Energy Publishing. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/tj696md6011 Source data was developed using the State University of New York/Albany satellite radiation model.  This model was developed by Dr. Richard Perez and collaborators at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and other universities for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Perez, et al. (2002). This model uses hourly radiance images from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. A modified Bird model is used to calculate clear sky direct normal (DNI).  This is then adjusted as a function of the  ratio of clear sky global horizontal (GHI) and the model predicted GHI.   Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalable at a 10km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 15% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other microclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
