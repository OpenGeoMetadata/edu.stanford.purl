  "dc_description_s": "Wildfire can cause serious and long-lasting damage to ecosystems. Following National Fire Plan concepts, this raster dataset depicts the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Fire Resource and Protection Program's (FRAP) use of data specific to the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California to describe ecosystems and fire-related metrics used in other analyses to define and describe fire-related risks to ecosystems. Fundamental to this idea is that current expected fires are compared to historic fire regimes with respect to fire frequency, size, patchiness and effects on key ecosystem elements and processes. Thus, these classes are then assigned based on current vegetation type and structure, an understanding of its pre-settlement fire regime and current conditions regarding expected fire frequency and potential fire behavior. As a result of these efforts, Condition Classes were defined as the â€œrelative risk of losing key components that define an ecosystem\" (Hardy et al., 2001). Source data was compiled by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.
