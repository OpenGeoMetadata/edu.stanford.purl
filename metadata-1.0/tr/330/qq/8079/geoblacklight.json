  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains the locations of vista points along the California State Highway System as of 2015. Vista points are informal pullouts where motorists can safely view scenery or park and relax. They do not include rest rooms. Vista points may have facilities including walkways, interpretive displays, railings, benches, interpretive information, trash receptacles, monuments and other pedestrian facilities that are accessible to all persons. California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Division of Maintenance created this layer by retrieving vista information from the Asset Management Inventory (AMI) database owned by Right of Way. ). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.
