  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains the locations of commuter park and ride lots in the California state highway system as of 2016. The park and ride lots provide a location for individuals to park their vehicles to join carpools and to access bus and rail services, thereby taking vehicles off local streets and roads and the State Highway System. This layer is derived from a “Park &amp;amp; Ride Inventory” excel spreadsheet maintained by California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), Division of Traffic Operations, Office of System Management Operations. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.
