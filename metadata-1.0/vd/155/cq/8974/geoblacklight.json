  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents the least disturbed watersheds in the County of Santa Cruz, California as defined in General Plan adopted May 24, 1994. These watersheds which are relatively undisturbed by development and worthy of recognition for their importance and designated for continued protection. Least disturbed watershed areas serve water supply, recreation and wildlife habitat functions, as well as provide a scenic backdrop; they have clear running streams, a high percentage of old growth redwoods, few roads and almost no residential development. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California. The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. The GIS Unit serves all County departments and external customers and provides data on land, features and people of Santa Cruz County. Santa Cruz County encompasses 4 cities and approximately 265,000 people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.

Available at http://purl.stanford.edu/vd155cq8974. GIS Layer Number = 40/ Original Mapping Source: San Lorenzo Valley Area General Plan, 1974; Parks Recreation and Open Space (PROS) Plan; Local Coastal Plan, Land Use Plan, Resource and Constraint Maps. Map Used to Convert to GIS: Source Maps. New Information Acceptable for Updating Maps: General Plan Amendment. Parcel Specific Overiding Information: Topographic survey by licensed surveyor. Source maps boundaries were traced or transferred to USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle sheets. Boundaries were then digitized using known control points or interesections of roads for reference. For some sheets, as few as two known control points were available. The digital lines were plotted and reviewed by the Water Quality Program Manager of the County's Environmental Health staff. \n\nCounty of Santa Cruz Planning Department General Plan (adopted May 24, 1994): http://www.sccoplanning.com/PlanningHome/SustainabilityPlanning/GeneralPlan.aspx These data were compiled from many different sources; therefore, the accuracy of the individual layers varies significantly, and some layers do not align exactly with others. In the urban areas, data are generally accurate within five to ten feet of their true geographic coordinates, but in the rural areas, data may be accurate to only within three hundred feet.
