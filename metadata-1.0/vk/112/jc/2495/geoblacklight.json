  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset depicts a habitat suitability analysis using the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) California Wildlife Habitat Relationships (CHWR) range and habitat suitability values conducted by the Conservation Lands Network (CLN) Team. CWHR provides habitat suitability values by vegetation type for wildlife species. The first step was to correlate, or crosswalk, the CWHR vegetation types with the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project Coarse Filter vegetation types so that CWHR habitat suitability values (the average suitability across all stages of each vegetation type) could be assigned to Upland Habitat Goals vegetation types. CWHR habitat suitability values range from 0 to 1, with higher values representing vegetation types of higher suitability for the target species. The Project Team created maps for twelve target species showing habitat suitability for the CWHR range, and CDFW California Natural Diversity Database and the University of California Berkeley Museum of Vertebrate Zoology records. A second map was derived by overlaying the Coarse Filter CLN on the first map to expose gaps in suitable habitat coverage. These maps helped the Project Team determine if the CLN was providing adequate coverage for the species that needed further review.This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
