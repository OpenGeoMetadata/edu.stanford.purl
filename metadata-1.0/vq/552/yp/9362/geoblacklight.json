  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts liquefaction hazard zones applicable to the unincorporated areas of the County of Santa Clara, California.. According to the United States Geological Survey, liquefaction is the ability of materials, such as clay, sand and gravel, to momentarily lose their ability to support surface structures, including roads, in the event of an earthquake. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Santa Clara County, California. The Santa Clara County Planning Office is part of the Department of Planning and Development. Their primary function is to plan and regulate land use and development within the unincorporated portions of Santa Clara County. Other responsibilities include policy analysis, GIS services, research and technical assistance relating to land use, housing, environmental protection, historic preservation and demographics. The Geographic Information Services Department has taken on all those activities related to GIS data and GIS process and procedures that cross organizational boundaries. Santa Clara County encompasses 15 cities and approximately 1.7 million people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.
