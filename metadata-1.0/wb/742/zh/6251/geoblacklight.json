  "dc_description_s": "This raster layer is a void-filled digital elevation model (DEM) of Africa at 30 arc-seconds resolution. Elevations is in meters referenced to the WGS84 EGM96 geoid. The primary data source of HydroSHEDS is the digital elevation model of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. SRTM elevation data were obtained by a specially modified radar system that flew onboard the Space Shuttle Endeavor during an 11-day mission in February of 2000. Regions of no-data (voids), specifically mountainous regions, or those over large water bodies prevented the production of reliable elevation data. The existence of no-data in the DEM causes significant problems for deriving hydrological products, which require continuous flow surfaces. Therefore, a void-filling procedure has been applied to provide a continuous DEM for HydroSHEDS.The goal of developing HydroSHEDS was to generate key data layers to support regional and global watershed analyses, hydrological modeling, and freshwater conservation planning at a quality, resolution and extent that had previously been unachievable.",
