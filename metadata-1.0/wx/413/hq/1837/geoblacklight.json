  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile contains the road network digitized from a map entitled \"Composite Map: (Facsimile) Rocque's Map of London. 1746.\" Published in 1919, this composite map is considered one of the best facsimiles of the original Rocque Map (\"A plan of the cities of London and Westminster, and borough of Southwark\"), created by John Rocque and first published in 1746. A scanned version of this map available from The David Rumsey Map Collection was georeferenced by the Kindred London mapping project. Segments of roads, paths, bridges, tunnels, water crossings, and stairs, were digitized using route name and type, traffic volume, and access.The broad goal of the Kindred London project is to create four digitized road networks from four historic maps of London that will be used for an online, interactive web platform that will allow users to experience what it would have been like to travel the streets of London.",
