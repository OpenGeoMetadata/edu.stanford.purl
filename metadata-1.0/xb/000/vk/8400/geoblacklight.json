  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts pluvial lakes mostly in North America ranked by relative importance, coordinating with river ranking. Includes name attributes. Originator of pluvial (late quaternary) lake data is Mifflin, M.D., and Wheat, M.M. in 1979 and then digitized in 1996 as part of the DDS 41 series from U.S. Geological Survey. Another of their sources was King, G. Q. in unpublished Material: “Late Pleistocene lakes and glaciers of the Great Basin” by Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology in 1975. Digitized the King map and added this to the Nevada map. Added a few lakes not on NBMG Bulletin 94. These data are represented at 1:10,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0). Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software. Kelso, N.V. and Patterson, T.
