The data represent commodities covered by the Minerals Information Team (MIT) of the U.S. Geological Survey, and the operations are those considered active in 2003 and surveyed by the MIT. This is a revised version of the June 2004 map layer. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition National Atlas of the United States. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey or the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data. National Atlas of the United States. (2005).

Additional minerals operations information can be obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey Minerals Information web page at &lt;http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/&gt;. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
