  "dc_description_s": "This map illustrates satellite-detected, potentially damaged structures in the southwestern part of Cuauhtemoc Municipality, Federal District, Mexico. The analyzed area is located approximately 120 km northwest of the main shock epicenter of the 19 September 2017 M7.1 earthquake. The analysis was performed using a post-event WorldView-2 satellite image acquired on 26 September 2017 and a pre-event Bing basemap. UNITAR-UNOSAT identified 145 potentially damaged structures from which 25 are located in Roma Norte suburb, 24 in Roma Sur, 21 in Hipodromo and 20 in La Condesa. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation of flood waters.
