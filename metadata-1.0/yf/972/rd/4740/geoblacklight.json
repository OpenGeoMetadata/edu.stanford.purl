  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile features stream cross section data from the Russian River mainstem and describes 1998 project limits, tree dripline, DEM breaklines, channel and gravel roads for the Middle Reach. The original source data from which this GIS file was created was contributed to the RRGIS by the Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA). The Sonoma County Water Agency gathers stream cross section data for the Russian River mainstem on a yearly basis. Comprehensive stream cross sectional information was contributed to the RRGIS for the years 1993 through 2001. Additional cross section data describing conditions as far back as 1990 was at times included in certain files. The contriubted data were in a variety of file formats including .txt , .xls and .dwg. During an advisory meeting with fisheries biologists, it was determined that converting the SCWA cross section data into a GIS formatted file was a high priority for local salmonid recovery planning efforts. This dataset is intended to be used for mapping and analysis. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002).
