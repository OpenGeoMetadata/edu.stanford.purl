  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents the portion of the Federal Emergenecy Management Q3 Flood Data Management maps within the Russian River basin region of California. Flood Data are derived from the 1:24000 Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMS) published by FEMA. This layer can be used for watershed analysis and planning in the Russian River region of California. The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).\nInsurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act Specifications for the digitizing\nof FIRMs to create the Q3 Flood Data are consistent with those\nrequirements for mapping at a scale of 1:24000. Horizontal control of\nQ3 Flood Data was established using USGS quadrangle maps at 1:24000 or\nother standard scales. Users should assess the horizontal positional\nsources and the requirements of their application. With increased\nfrequency, large-scale spatial data sets are becoming widely available\nfor computer-based geographic information systems. Q3 Flood Data may be\nused in combination with other digital spatial data, however, users\nshould be aware that scalar enlargements do not enhance the relative\naccuracy of the Q3 Flood Data (i.e. 1:24000).
