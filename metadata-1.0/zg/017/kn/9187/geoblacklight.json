  "dc_description_s": "THis polygon shapefile depicts Resource Conservation Districts (RCD) boundaries within Sonoma County, California. RCDs continue to render assistance to private landowners wishing to conserve soil and water and manage their resources on a sustainable basis. But RCDs also act as a focal point for local conservation efforts, and RCDs throughout the state now function as leaders in the conservation community, including a large amount of watershed groups such as Coordinated Resource Management Planning (CRMP) groups throughout the state. The intended use of this layer is to describe the extent of RCD boundaries and to assist in watershed planning and analysis efforts.
