  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset is a georeferenced image containing land cover change classifications in southwest Cameroon between 2000 and 2015. Classifications are divided into 3 types of land cover change: unclassified (no change), non-forest (other) to oil palm/immature monoculture, and forest to oil palm/immature monoculture. These data are referenced in the corresponding publication: Ordway et al. 2018. Oil palm expansion and deforestation in Southwest Cameroon associated with proliferation of informal mills. Nature Communications. These data are intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.",
