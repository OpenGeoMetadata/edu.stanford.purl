  "dc_description_s": "At approximately 1 km resolution (30\" X 30\"), LandScan is the finest resolution global population distribution data available and represents an ambient population (average over 24 hours). The LandScan algorithm uses spatial data and imagery analysis technologies and a multi-variable dasymetric modeling approach to disaggregate census counts within an administrative boundary. Since no single population distribution model can account for the differences in spatial data availability, quality, scale, and accuracy as well as the differences in cultural settlement practices, LandScan population distribution models are tailored to match the data conditions and geographical nature of each individual country and region. \"The LandScan Global Population Databases, developed at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, represent the finest resolution global population distribution databases available\"--Legend on 2000 (East View Geospatial version, viewed March 22, 2013). The library provdes access to years 2000-2018. The data is provided in a format which is digestible in any GIS software that allows the user to import ESRI GRID-formatted data. The WMS and WCS are links to the data hosted on East View Geospatial's servers for organization-wide access and can be used with most current GIS software. The data files are also provided in the ESRI Raster Binary format--LandScan Frequently Asked Questions (East View Geospatial version, viewed March 22, 2013). Access restricted to subscribers. Description based on: 2000; title from home page (East View Geospatial version, viewed March 22, 2013). Latest issue consulted: 2018. System requirements: Web browser (all major Web browsers supported); GIS software required to import ESRI GRID-formatted data",
