    "The Bahamas Shoreline Type for InVEST Coastal Vulnerability Model was used for the analysis in Silver JM, Arkema KK, Griffin RM, Lashley B, Lemay M, Maldonado S, Moultrie SH, Ruckelshaus M, Schill S, Thomas A, Wyatt K and Verutes G (2019) Advancing Coastal Risk Reduction Science and Implementation by Accounting for Climate, Ecosystems, and People. Frontiers in Marine Science 6:556. doi: 10.3389/fmars.2019.00556. The shoreline is divided into homogeneous segments based on the geomorphology of the beach.  The attribute ShoreType is assigned to one of four classes: sand, mud, rock, or seawall.  Each shoreline type is assigned a relative exposure rank from 1 (low exposure) to 5 (high exposure) to indicate how susceptible the shore type is to erosion and inundation.  For this analysis, the following ranks were used: mud=4, rock=3, sand=5, seawall=2.",
    " The Shoreline Type layer with relative exposure ranks was an input layer to the InVest Coastal Vulnerability model used for the 2019 Bahamas Coastal Hazard Analysis.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
