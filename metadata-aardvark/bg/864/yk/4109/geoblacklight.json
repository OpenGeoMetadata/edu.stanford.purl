    "World map on Mercator's projection. Northwest passage shown from Destroit d'Anian, just north of California, through the Mer Glaciale to Butons Bay. Great Lakes included but not delineated. Five insets sit above the map depicting night and day, the world without water, the phases of the moon, and the western and eastern hemispheres. The small western hemisphere map also depicts California as an island. A similarly-sized derivative, also from the 1730s, was printed by R. & G. Wetstein (Entry 1001).",
