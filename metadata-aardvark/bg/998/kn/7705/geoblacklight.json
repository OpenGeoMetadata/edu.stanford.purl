  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This raster dataset (GeoTIFF) represents groundwater elevation in California using a color ramp. These data represent groundwater changes between spring 2013 and spring 2014. This layer is a smoothed approximation of the groundwater level 'surface' based on the measurement data. The measurement values may not exactly match the color ramp values because of the smoothing process.",
    "This layer is intended to be used as a compliment to data, reports, and other information provided by the California Groundwater Information Center.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
