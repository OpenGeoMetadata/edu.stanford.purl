  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile depicts polygon labels of major physical features worldwide, including deserts, mountain ranges, plateaus, island groupings and continents. Data was derived primarily from the Florida Resources and Environmental Analysis Center's Physical Map of the World. These data are represented at 1:10,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0).",
    "Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software."
