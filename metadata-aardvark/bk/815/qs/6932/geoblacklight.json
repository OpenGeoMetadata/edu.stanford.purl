  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile depicts parent material of soils in the County of Santa Clara, California, including the general physical, chemical and mineralogical composition of the unconsolidated material, mineral or organic, in which the soil forms. Mode of deposition and/or weathering may be implied by the name. The soil surveyor uses parent material to develop a model used for soil mapping. Soil scientists and specialists in other disciplines use parent material to help interpret soil boundaries and project performance of the material below the soil. Many soil properties relate to Parent Material, including properties are proportions of sand, silt and clay; chemical content; bulk density; structure; and the kinds and amounts of rock fragments. These properties affect interpretations and may be criteria used to separate soil series. Soil properties and landscape information may imply the kind of Parent Material. These data were compiled from the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey in the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database. Santa Clara County is divided into two soil surveys; a western part (CA 641, last updated: Tabular: Version 3, Sept 18, 2014. Spatial: Version 2, Dec 13, 2013) and an eastern part (CA 646, last updated Tabular: Version 9, Sept 25, 2014, Spatial: Version 4, Sept 19, 2014). This dataset combines those two surveys into one, easier to use dataset that covers the entire county. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Santa Clara County, California.",
    "The Santa Clara County Planning Office is part of the Department of Planning and Development. Their primary function is to plan and regulate land use and development within the unincorporated portions of Santa Clara County. Other responsibilities include policy analysis, GIS services, research and technical assistance relating to land use, housing, environmental protection, historic preservation and demographics. The Geographic Information Services Department has taken on all those activities related to GIS data and GIS process and procedures that cross organizational boundaries. Santa Clara County encompasses 15 cities and approximately 1.7 million people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
