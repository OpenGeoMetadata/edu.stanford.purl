    "This polygon shapefile contains nonattainment areas for particulate matter &lt; 10 microns. Nonattainment areas are geographic areas which have not met national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter air pollution. These standards are part of the Clean Air Act. See Code of Federal Regulations, Section 40 Part 81, for detailed information about Ambient Air Quality Standards.",
