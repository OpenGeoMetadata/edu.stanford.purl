    "This layer is a georeferenced image of a map of the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.), originally created by James Kelly in 1851. The original map appears in \"A Series of Charts, With Sailing Directions, Embracing Surveys of the Farallones, Entrance to the Bay of San Francisco...State of California... Third Edition, With Additions.\" The original map and this image are from the Library of Congress, Geography and Map Division. The georectifed map image was created by the David Rumsey Map Collection.",
    "The historic map layers in the Google Earth Rumsey Map Collection have been selected by David Rumsey from his large collection of historical maps, as well as some from other collections with which he collaborates. All the maps contain rich information about the past and represent a sampling of time periods, scales, and cartographic art, resulting in visual history stories that only old maps can tell. Each map has been georeferenced by Rumsey, thus creating unique digital map images that allow the old maps to appear in their correct places on the modern globe.  Some of the maps fit perfectly in their modern spaces, while othersgenerally earlier period mapsreveal interesting geographical misconceptions of their time.  Cultural features on the maps can be compared to the modern satellite views using the slider bars to adjust transparency. The result is an exploration of time as well as space, a marriage of historic cartographic masterpieces with innovative contemporary software tools.",
