  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile contains core based statistical areas in the United States and Puerto Rico. The map layer was created from the CENSUS 2010 TIGER/Line files produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) comprise both Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas. CBSAs are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and consist of the county, counties, or equivalent entities associated with at least one urban core (urbanized area or urban cluster) having a population of at least 10,000. Adjacent counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured through commuting ties with the counties containing the core are included as part of a CBSA. There are two categories of CBSAs: Metropolitan Statistical Areas are CBSAs associated with at least one urbanized area that has a population of at least 50,000. The metropolitan statistical area comprises the central county or counties or equivalent entities containing the core, plus adjacent outlying counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the central county or counties as measured through commuting. Micropolitan Statistical Areas are CBSAs associated with at least one urban cluster that has a population of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000. The micropolitan statistical area comprises the central county or counties or equivalent entities containing the core, plus adjacent outlying counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the central county or counties as measured through commuting. The CBSAs for the 2010 Census are those defined by OMB and published in December 2009. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States.",
