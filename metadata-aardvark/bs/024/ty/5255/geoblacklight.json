  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This dataset shares the results of a 2019 coastal hazard and social vulnerability assessment for the entire coastline of The Bahamas.  The analysis was conducted at a 250 m resolution and each shore point shows the modeled results relating to exposure to coastal hazards, population at risk and the potential for ecosystems to provide coastal protection for each 250 m segment.",
    " These model results were used to conduct the analysis for a peer-reviewed paper and are presented in a web map viewer used by the Bahamian government, NGOs, and the general public to look at shoreline exposure and vulnerability for the different SLR and habitat scenarios.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
