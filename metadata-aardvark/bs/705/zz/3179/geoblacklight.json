The Code of Federal Regulations designates areas that have required speed restriction to protect North Atlantic Right Whales. Vessels shall travel at a speed of 10 knots or less over ground in the following areas during the allotted season: New York/New Jersey Port Seasonal Management Area, Block Island Sound, Great South Channel, Off Race Point, and the Cape Cod Seasonal Management Area. The following restrictions apply to: All vessels greater than or equal to 65 ft (19.8 m) in overall length and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and all other vessels greater than or equal to 65 ft (19.8 m) in overall length entering or departing a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. These restrictions shall not apply to U.S. vessels owned or operated by, or under contract to, the Federal Government. This exemption extends to foreign sovereign vessels when they are engaging in joint exercises with the U.S. Department of the Navy. In addition these restrictions do not apply to law enforcement vessels of a State, or political subdivision thereof, when engaged in law enforcement or search and rescue duties. Where necessary and applicable, boundaries that were coincident with the shoreline or with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) were integrated into the dataset.",
