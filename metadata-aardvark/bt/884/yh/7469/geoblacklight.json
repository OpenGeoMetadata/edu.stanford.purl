    "This polygon shapefile contains the boundaries of urban blocks in Paris during 1652. These data were taken form the Gomboust plan and characterize urban desity levels for each block according to the representation on the plan (low, medium, high).",
    "The ALPAGE programme aims to provide collaborative tools for the Humanities and Social Sciences and for Information Communication Technology (ICT) allowing for the development of research about the Parisian urban area. This aim is achieved by means of a GIS that includes cadastral and historical layers.",

All data produced within the consortium is published in this way with the exception of any ongoing work which is in process of academic evaluation (masters, doctoral thesis, habilitation to supervise research).",
