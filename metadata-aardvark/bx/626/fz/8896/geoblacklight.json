    "This polygon shapefile describes the landuse and landcover of the Mendocino Reach of the Russian River in 1992. The Mendocino Reach extent is defined by the Hopland, Hwy. 101 Bridge and the town of Calpella, Mendocino County, California. This dataset is one of six datasets that together, form the GIS data for the Russian River Resource Enhancement Plan and Public Access Plan (Enhancement Plan). Each of the .shp files listed above is intended to be linked to a .dbf using the 'ACADTEXT' attribute column. The .dbf files were created as a part of the original Enhancement Plan, not the Russian River Watershed GIS.Link this file with rip1_90.dbf for riparian habitat successional status information.",
    "This layer can be used for land use analysis and planning in the Russian River region of California.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
