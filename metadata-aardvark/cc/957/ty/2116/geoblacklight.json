    "This point shapefile represents electric power generating plants in the United States by energy source. This includes plants that are operating, on standby, or short- or long-term out of service. The surveys collect data on all plants with a combined nameplate capacity of 1 MW or more. These data were gathered from EIA-860, Annual Electric Generator Report, EIA-860M, Monthly Update to the Annual Electric Generator Report, and EIA-923, Power Plant Operations Report. These data are current as of August 2014. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data produced by the U.S. National Energy Information Administration.",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
