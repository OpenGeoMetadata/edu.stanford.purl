    "This layer illustrates target areas as submitted by Choice Neighborhood Program award grantees. Choice Neighborhoods grants build upon the successes of public housing transformation under HOPE VI to provide support for the preservation and rehabilitation of public and HUD-assisted housing, within the context of a broader approach to concentrated poverty. In addition to public housing authorities, the initiative involves local governments, non-profits, and for-profit developers in undertaking comprehensive local planning with residents and the community. To learn more about the Choice Neighborhoods grants program, please visit the following website: https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/ph/cn/Data Dictionary: DD_Choice Grantees",
