    "The Local Employment Dynamics (LED) Partnership is a voluntary federal-state enterprise created for the purpose of merging employee, and employer data to provide a set of enhanced labor market statistics known collectively as Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI). The QWI are a set of economic indicators including employment, job creation, earnings, and other measures of employment flows.\nFor the purposes of this dataset, LED data for 2018 is aggregated to Census Summary Level 070 (State + County + County Subdivision + Place/Remainder), and joined with the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program grantee areas spatial dataset for FY2019.\nEstablished in 1974, the Community Development Block Grant Program provides annual grant funding to local and state governments to address a wide range of unique community development needs.\n\n\nHUD determines the amount of each grant by using a formula comprised of several measures of community need, including the extent of poverty, population, housing density, age of housing, and population growth relative to other metropolitan areas.\n\nThe annual CDBG appropriation is allocated among states and local jurisdictions categorized as &quot;entitlement&quot; and &quot;non-entitlement&quot; communities respectively. Entitlement communities are comprised of the principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); metropolitan cities with populations of at least 50,000; and qualified urban counties with a population of 200,000 or more (excluding the populations of entitlement cities). Non-entitlement communities receive CDBG funding from their respective states in accordance with requirements that state.\n\n\n\n \nTo learn more about the Local Employment Dynamics (LED) Partnership visit: https://lehd.ces.census.gov/\n  \n  \n  Data Dictionary: DD_LED for CDBG Grantee Areas\n  \n  Date of Coverage: CDBG-2021/LED-2018",
