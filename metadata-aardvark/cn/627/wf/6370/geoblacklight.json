    "This polygon shapefile contains estimates of biomass resource potential for the lower 48 states of the United States. The following feedstock categories are considered for this study: crop residues, methane emissions from manure management, methane emissions from landfills and wastewater treatment facilities, forest residues, primary and secondary mill residues, urban wood waste, and dedicated energy crops. This layer is a part of a collection of GIS data containing renewable and electric energy information for the U.S., including data on transmission lines, power plants and electricity substations.",
    "This shapefile can aid in estimating biomass resource availability in counties within the United States.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
