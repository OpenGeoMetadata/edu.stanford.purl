    "This raster dataset is a global model of artisanal fishing based on small scale fisheries data and population proximity to coastal areas. See the Lineage section for complete information regarding data sources and processes. This approach to estimating the impact of artisanal fishing cannot distinguish between methods that do and do not modify habitat. Some developing nations have a high rate of habitat-modifying artisanal fishing and our estimate of the impact of this activity in those locations will be underestimated. Unfortunately, the distribution of habitat-modifying fishing methods is currently unknown in a globally-comparable way. Artisanal fishing is notoriously difficult to estimate our approach uses coarse FAO estimates, models missing national data, and then models the small-scale distribution of national data. This dataset is part of the Global Map of Human Impacts to Marine Ecosystems, a collection of data and analyses related to anthropogenic drivers of change in marine ecosystems.",
    "The goal of this research is to estimate and visualize the global impact that humans are having on the oceans' ecosystems.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
