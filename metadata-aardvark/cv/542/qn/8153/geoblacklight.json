  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This raster layer is a georeferenced image containing tree canopy data for Alaska, in an Albers Equal-Area Conic projection and at a resolution of 100 meters. The tree canopy data were derived from the 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) Percent Tree Canopy data set, a product of the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC). The MRLC is a multi-agency cooperative effort to study land cover change. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States.",
    "The 100-meter resolution tree canopy data were developed to portray the tree canopy of the United States at 1:1,000,000 scale. They are intended primarily for visual purposes. The original NLCD data should be used for conducting scientific analysis.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
