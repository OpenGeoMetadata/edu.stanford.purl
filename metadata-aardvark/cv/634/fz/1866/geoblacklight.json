    "The Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) is a formula grant program established under the Fair Housing Act which allows for state and local agencies to assist in the enforcement of the Act. If such agencies are determined by FHEO to enforce state or local fair housing laws that are substantially equivalent to the federal Fair Housing Act, they can receive financial and operational assistance from FHEO to enforce such laws. There are periodic changes to the roster of FHAP agencies as new agencies are admitted to the program, or existing agencies withdraw or are determined to no longer have laws and procedures which are substantially equivalent to the federal statue. FHAP agencies receive funding from HUD to support their efforts. Payments are made once a year after the end of the period of performance for that agency.\nTo learn more about the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) visit: https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/partners/FHAP\n  \n  \n  Data Dictionary: DD_Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) \nDate of Coverage: FY2023",
