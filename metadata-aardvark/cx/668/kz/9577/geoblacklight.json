SMI performs bridge inspections in accordance with federal regulations on over 12,000 State Highway bridges and approximately 12,200 bridges owned by local government agencies. Caltrans bridge inspectors are responsible for maintaining the safety and integrity of over 24000 bridges owned by the State of California and California's local government agencies.
