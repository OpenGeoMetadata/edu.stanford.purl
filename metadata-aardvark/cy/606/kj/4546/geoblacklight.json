    "This polyline shapefile depicts all National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) streams falling within the urban areas of the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California (as defined by the California Department of Conversation Farming Mapping and Monitoring Program). To create this layer, a simple clip was performed using the 2008 Farming Mapping and Monitoring Program Urban layer. This was useful to the Fish and Riparian Focus Team to give the Team an idea of how many miles of creeks fall in urban areas and their general locations.",
    "This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
