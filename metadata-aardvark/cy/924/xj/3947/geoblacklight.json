    "This raster dataset shows administrative districts in Hungary. The source of the map is the 1:10 000 scale, house number depth vector map file, the DSM-10 map,  which is made for all settlements of the country - their interior and exterior - in a uniform structure and data content. The data content of the DSM-10 map file has been constantly expanding since 1998, based on on-site surveys, state data sources and user feedback, so the data content of the GeoX Kft.raster map is constantly being updated.",
