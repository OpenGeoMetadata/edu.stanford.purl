    "This collection contains GIS data in shapefile and GeoTIFF formats originally obtained from the California Groundwater Information Center (GIC) interactive map. The GIC is the Department of Water Resources' source for groundwater information, groundwater management plans, water well basics, and statewide and regional reports, maps and figures. California's groundwater provides approximately 30 to 46 percent of the State's total water supply, depending on wet or dry years, and serves as a critical buffer against drought and climate change. Some communities in California are 100 percent reliant upon groundwater for urban and agricultural use."
