  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This line shapefile represents the Russian River Watershed portion of the California Salmonid Habitat Inventory- a quantitative stream habitat survey focused on stream habitat restoration. Field biologists walk in-stream from confluence to headwaters of streams identifying pools, riffles, and flatwater areas as individual habitat units. Quantitative attributes include width, depth, substrate, bank vegetation, and slope to help identify restoration potential, stream health and monitoring potential.",
    "This data is inteded to aid in internal managment descisions regarding stream restoration projects and potential.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
