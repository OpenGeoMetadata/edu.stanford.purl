    "Shows both sides of Moldavia following the Russian Empire's seizure of Basarabia from the Ottoman Empire in 1812, along with part of Bukovina in the north and Dobruja in the south. It is taken from the rare General Atlas, by the abbot Bartolomeo Borhi, published in Siena by Pazzini Carli. Many of the maps were first dated between 1788 and 1800 and engraved by Agostino Costa, then later incorporated in Borghi's Atlas, which was published in Florence in 1818 or 1819. Here we see, in addition to Russia's seizure of Basarabia a few years early, the intrusion of Poland on the north-western banks of the Niester (also called here Nistro) River.",
