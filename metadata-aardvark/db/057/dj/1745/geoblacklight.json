    "This point shapefile identifies 194 marine and inland port locations used by marine fisheries for the landing and sale of fish and invertebrates. Each port has a code identifier which is linked to fishery landings at that port. The code is referenced in several other fishery datasets in this collection. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Department of Fish &amp; Game.",
    "Port identification and location is used to analyze and map marine fishery activities by geographic region throughout California.",
