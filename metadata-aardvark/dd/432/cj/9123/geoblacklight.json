  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polyline shapefile depicts centerlines for an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information, including water, railroad and road features, for the County of Santa Clara, California from the United States Census Bureau Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB) for 2014. The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Edge refers to the linear topological primitives that make up MTDB. This \"All Lines\" shapefile contains linear features such as roads, railroads, and hydrography. Additional attribute data associated with the linear features found in the \"All Lines\" shapefile are available in relational (.dbf) files that users must download separately. The \"All Lines\" shapefile contains the geometry and attributes of each topological primitive edge. Each edge has a unique TIGER/Line identifier (TLID) value. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Santa Clara County, California.",
    "In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
