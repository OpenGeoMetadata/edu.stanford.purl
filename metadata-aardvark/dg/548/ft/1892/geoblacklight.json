  "dct_description_sm": [
    "Eez1000 is a 1000 meter resolution statewide bathymetric dataset that generally covers the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), an area extending 200 nautical miles from all United States possessions and trust territories. The data was adapted from isobath values ranging from 200 meters to 4800 meters below sea level; therefore nearshore depictions ARE NOT ACCURATE and \"flatten out\" between 200 meter depths and the coastline. The data is intended only for general portrayals of offshore features and depths. The Department of Fish and Game (DFG), Technical Services Branch (TSB) GIS Unit received the source data in the form of a line contour coverage (known as DFG's eezbath) from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The contour data was converted to a TIN (triangulated irregular network) using ArcView 3D Analyst and then converted to a grid. The contour data was previously reprojected by TSB to Albers conic equal-area using standard Teale Data Center parameters. Some minor aesthetic editing was performed on peripheral areas using the ARC/INFO Grid EXPAND function. The image version was created using the ARC/INFO GRIDIMAGE function. Please see the attached metadata file \"eezbatcall.doc\" or the DFG coverage metadata \"eezbath.txt\" for further source data information.",
