    "This polygon shapefile depicts groundwater basins and sub-basins as defined by the California Department of Water Resources, and are designated on the basis of geological and hydrological conditions such as the occurrence of alluvial or unconsolidated deposits. When practical, large basins are also subdivided by political boundaries, as in the Central Valley. Basins are named and numbered per the convention of the Department of Water Resources.",
