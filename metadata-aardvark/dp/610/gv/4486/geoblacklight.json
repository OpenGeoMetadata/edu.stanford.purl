    "This line shapefile of salmonid habitat data is summarized at the geomorphic reach level using the Rosgen classification of channel type. Data collected from in-stream salmonid habitat surveys were done or supervised by the California Department of Fish and Game from 1994 to 2001.",
    "This dataset is intended for salmonid habitat restoration planning at a scale between the habitat unit level and the entire tributary level, with a focus on the geomorphic reach.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
