  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile represents geological units (such as fault contacts, lithographic contacts and the watershed boundary) within the Freshwater Creek watershed in Humboldt County, California at 1:24,000 scale. These data were derived from digital maps of landslide potential and geologic features in Humboldt County originally published in 1999 by the California Division of Mines and Geology (OFR 99-10 and OFR 99-10a). The data for the original mapping were compiled from multiple sources including published maps and reports, aerial photograph mapping, and reconnaissance geologic mapping.",
    "The maps/data are useful in preparation of Timber Harvesting Plans, and for use by land managers for identifying areas of potentially unstable ground. The maps/data serve as a guide to potential problem areas where more site-specific review is required.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
