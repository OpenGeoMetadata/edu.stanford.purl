    "This polygon shapefile contains the boundaries of urban blocks in Paris during 1553. These data were taken form the Basel plan and characterize urban desity levels for each block according to the representation on the plan (low, medium, high). The Plan of Truschet and Hoyau (called the Basel Plan), shows the city around 1552-1553.",
    "The ALPAGE programme aims to provide collaborative tools for the Humanities and Social Sciences and for Information Communication Technology (ICT) allowing for the development of research about the Parisian urban area. This aim is achieved by means of a GIS that includes cadastral and historical layers.",
