    "This polygon shapefile represents geographic entities, defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use by Federal statistical agencies, based on the concept of a core area with a large population nucleus, plus adjacent communities having a high degree of economic and social integration with that core. A Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) consists of a U.S. county or counties or equivalent entities associated with at least one core (urbanized area or urban cluster) with a population of at least 10,000 along with any adjacent counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured through commuting ties with the counties containing the core. CBSAs are categorized as being either Metropolitan or Micropolitan. Each Metropolitan Statistical Area must have at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more inhabitants. Each Micropolitan Statistical Area must have at least one urban cluster with a population of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000. This layer is part of the 2014 ESRI Data and Maps collection for ArcGIS 10.2.",
