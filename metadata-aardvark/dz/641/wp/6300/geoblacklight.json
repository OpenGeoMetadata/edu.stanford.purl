    "The U.S. Census Bureau, Center for Economic Studies, annual Local Employment Dynamics (LED) database provides a summary of job and worker counts and shares by industry sector. LED data is available at the Census Block geography and aggregated to Summary Level 070 (State + County + County Subdivision + Place/Remainder) geography where it is combined with the HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME) information to create the grantee areas. The HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME) is authorized under Title II of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. HOME provides formula grants to States and localities that communities use often in partnership with local nonprofit groups to fund a wide range of activities that build, buy, and/or rehabilitate affordable housing for rent or homeownership or provide direct rental assistance to low-income people. Data is current as of Fiscal Year 2016, Census LED: 2013",
    "This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)"
