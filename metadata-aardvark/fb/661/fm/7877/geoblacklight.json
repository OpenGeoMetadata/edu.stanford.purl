  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This raster layer is a georeferenced image containing impervious surface data for Hawaii. Data are in an Albers Equal-Area Conic projection and have a resolution of 100 meters. The impervious surface data were derived from the 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) Percent Developed Imperviousness data set, a product of the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC). The MRLC is a multi-agency cooperative effort to study land cover change. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States.",
    "The 100-meter resolution impervious surface data were developed to portray the impervious surface of the United States at 1:1,000,000 scale. They are intended primarily for visual purposes. The original NLCD data should be used for conducting scientific analysis.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
