    "This polygon shapefile shows the watershed boundaries of the Russian River Basin. These data are derived from the California Watershed Map (v.2.2), a set of standardized watershed boundaries meeting standardized delineation criteria. The calw22a watersheds were selected based on their attribute values from the HUNAME field which indicates the Hydologic Unit Name of each watershed.",
    "This shapefile provides the basis for mapping, reporting, and statistical analysis of water resources, water supply, water quality, wildlands, agriculture, soils, forests, rangelands, fish habitat, wildlife habitat, cross-referencing state and federal hydrologic unit or watershed codes and names.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
