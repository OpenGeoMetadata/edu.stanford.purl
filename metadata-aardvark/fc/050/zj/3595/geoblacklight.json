    "This map layer shows streams of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The map layer was produced primarily from the Medium-Resolution and High-Resolution National Hydrography Dataset NHDFlowline feature classes, through feature selection and cartographic generalization based on reference to published small-scale ancillary data sets. This is a revised version of the August 2012 map layer.",
    "These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
