  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polyline shapefile represents railroads in North America only. The “basic” railroads at 10m scale are from Commission for Environmental Cooperation's North America Environmental Atlas with no attributes and only 1 scale rank class. There are no attributes and precision XY accuracy is to 20m not 10m. These data are represented at 1:10,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0).",
    "Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software."
