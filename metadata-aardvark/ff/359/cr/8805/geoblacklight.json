    "This polygon shapefile depicts the Coho Salmon Priority Restoration Areas in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southwest Region, North-Central California Coast Recovery Team. These areas cover the North-Central California Coast Recovery Domain and are pertinent for the Central California Coast Coho Salmon Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU). Once a species is listed as a threatened or endangered, the Endangered Species Act mandates that a Recovery Plan be developed and implemented. The Recovery Plan guides implementation of actions to recover the species by resolving the threats to it and ensuring self-sustaining populations in the wild. The polygons in this layer depict the areas identified as: \"Core\" (Subwatersheds with persisting populations of coho salmon. Maintaining Core areas is essential for preventing the extinction of CCC coho salmon and these Core areas are targeted for immediate threat abatement and enhancement and restoration actions.); Phase 1 (Areas outside of Core subwatersheds, designated as necessary for recovery actions to expand current populations); and Phase 2 (Areas outside of Core subwatersheds, typically more degraded than Core and Phase I areas. Restoring watershed processes and preventing further degradation will likely take an extended period of time in these areas).",
    "This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
