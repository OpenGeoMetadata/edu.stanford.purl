    "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Real Estate Owned (REO) properties are the result of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) paying a claim to a lending institution on a foreclosed property which was financed with an FHA Insured Mortgage, and the lender has transferred ownership of the property of to HUD. Typically, title to the property is not transferred (or the claim paid) until the previous owner is evicted from the property. Normally, after the home is transferred to HUD, the property will go up for auction on the HUD Home store website.Location data for HUD-related properties and facilities are derived from HUD's enterprise geocoding service. Note that these data only include latitude and longitude coordinates and associated attributes for those addresses that can be geocoded to an interpolated point along a street segment, or to a ZIP+4 centroid location. While not all records are able to be geocoded and mapped, we are continuously working to improve the address data quality and enhance coverage. Please consider this issue when using any datasets provided by HUD.To learn more about HUD Real Estate Owned Properties visit: https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/reoData Dictionary: DD FHA REO Properties for SaleDate of Coverage: 11/2023 SnapshotLast Updated: 11/2023",
