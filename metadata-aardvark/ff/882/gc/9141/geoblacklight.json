  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile depicts natural and artificial lakes in North America only ranked by relative importance, coordinating with river ranking. Includes name attributes. Data primarily derives from the North American Environmental Atlas, a collaboration of government agencies in Canada, Mexico and the United States and the trilateral Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC). The modified CCM lakes offered here are intended for small-scale cartographic use. These data are represented at 1:10,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0).",
    "Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software."
