  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This point shapefile depicts locations of minor discharges into Southern California's near-coastal marine waters, but does not include discharges into enclosed bays and estuaries. The category 'Minor' used to describe this feature was derived from the Marine Life Protection Act South Coast Study Region Scientific Advisory Team conclusion that any facility that had a design flow rate less than 1 million gallons-per-day (MGD) would get a 'Minor' discharge rating. Small aquaculture facilities, desalination plants, and marine labs that discharge more than 1 MGD were included in the minor category.",
    "This coverage displays locations of and information about minor ocean wastewater discharges alongthe Southern California Bight, the curved coastline of Southern California between Point Conception and San Diego.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
