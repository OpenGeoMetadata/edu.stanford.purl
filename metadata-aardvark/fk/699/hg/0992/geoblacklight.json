All within drawing of 24-hour table clock. Mountain ranges shown in America. Another example observed with bannered title: Nulla dies abeat, quin linea ducta supersit. (above map) and with Johannes Georgio Eberspergerg fecit (below map). Probably cut from a title page of the Atlas series (Title Page Entry 15). Text to clock left and right entitled \"Bericht vom Nutzen und Gebrauch diser Uhr\".",
