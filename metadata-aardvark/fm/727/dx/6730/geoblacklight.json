    "This layer is a georeferenced raster image containing bathymetric data for the offshore area of Carpinteria, California. The map of the area was generated from data collected by California State University, Monterey Bay, Seafloor Mapping Lab (CSUMB), by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and by Fugro Pelagos for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Joint Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise. The southeastern nearshore and shelf areas, as well as the western midshelf area, were mapped by CSUMB in the summer of 2007, using a 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder. The western nearshore area, as well as the western outer shelf area, were mapped by the USGS in 2005 and 2006, using 117-kHz and 234.5-kHz SEA (AP) Ltd. SWATHplus-M phase-differencing sidescan sonars. The nearshore bathymetry and coastal topography were mapped for USACE by Fugro Pelagos in 2009, using the SHOALS-1000T bathymetric-lidar and Leica ALS60 topographic-lidar systems. All these mapping missions combined to collect bathymetry from the 0-m isobath to beyond the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. This layer is part of USGS Data Series 781. These data were also published in Scientific Investigations Map (SIM) 3261 (Sheets 1 &amp; 2). A map that shows these data is published in Scientific Investigations Map 3261, \"California State Waters Map Series--Offshore of Carpinteria, California.\" This layer is part of USGS Data Series 781.",
    "In 2007, the California Ocean Protection Council initiated the California Seafloor Mapping Program (CSMP) to create a comprehensive seafloor map of high-resolution bathymetry, marine benthic habitats and geology within the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. CSMP has divided coastal California into 110 map blocks, each to be published individually as United States Geological Survey Open-File Reports (OFRs) or Scientific Investigations Maps (SIMs) at a scale of 1:24,000. Maps display seafloor morphology and character, identify potential marine benthic habitats and illustrate both the seafloor geology and shallow (to about 100 m) subsurface geology. Data layers for bathymetry, bathymetric contours, acoustic backscatter, seafloor character, potential benthic habitat and offshore geology were created for each map block, as well as regional-scale data layers for sediment thickness, depth to transition, transgressive contours, isopachs, predicted distributions of benthic macro-invertebrates and visual observations of benthic habitat from video cruises over the entire state. This coverage can be used with geographic information systems or other software to identify bathymetric features. These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy  makers, and the general public. This information is not intended for navigational purposes.The data can be used with geographic information systems (GIS) software to display geologic and oceanographic information.",
