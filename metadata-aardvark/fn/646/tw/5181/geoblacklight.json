  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile contains the entire distribution for adult Treefish (Sebastes serriceps). The process of creating this shapefile included creating contour lines, in 5-meter intervals, from bathymetry lines. Depth ranges were taken from four references (see Resource Details Supplemental Information). After the broadest depth range was determined for this species, they were rounded to the nearest 5-meter interval. The deepest and shallowest shapefile lines were connected by a line at the northern end and southern end (determined by their geographical extent from north to south). This shapefile was then converted to polygon. The goal of this shapefile was to provide a range in which this species could occur, given that their habitat are present.",
