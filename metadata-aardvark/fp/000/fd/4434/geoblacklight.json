    "This layer is a continuous raster monthly and annual average tilted photovoltaic solar power resource potential for the continental United States averaged over surface cells of 0.1 degrees in both latitude and longitude (about 10 km in size). Tilted photovoltaic panels are those that are angled in order to maximize exposure to direct sunlight. Tilt angles are often equal to the site's latitude but may vary throughout the year. This layer is a part of a collection of GIS data containing renewable and electric energy information for the U.S., including data on transmission lines, power plants and electricity substations.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
