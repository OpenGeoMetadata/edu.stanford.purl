    "This raster dataset shows the locations of benthic structures (oil rigs) in the world's oceans. Structures included are gas and communication pipelines and oil extraction rigs. Benthic structures built in the ocean leave a footprint of destroyed habitat where they are built. See the Lineage section for complete information regarding data sources and processes. This dataset is part of the Global Map of Human Impacts to Marine Ecosystems, a collection of data and analyses related to anthropogenic drivers of change in marine ecosystems.",
    "The goal of this research is to estimate and visualize the global impact that humans are having on the oceans' ecosystems.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
