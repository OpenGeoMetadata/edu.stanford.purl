    "HUD provides support to a nationwide network of Housing Counseling Agencies (HCA) and counselors. HCA's are trained and approved to provide tools to current and prospective homeowners and renters so that they can make responsible choices to address their housing needs in light of their financial situations.     Location data for HUD-related properties and facilities are derived from HUD's enterprise geocoding service. Note that this file only includes x, y coordinates and associated attributes for those addresses that can be geocoded to an interpolated point along a street segment, or to the centroid of the nearest U.S. Census block. While not all records are able to be geocoded and mapped, we are continuously working to improve the address data quality and enhance coverage. Please consider this issue when using any datasets provided by HUD.
