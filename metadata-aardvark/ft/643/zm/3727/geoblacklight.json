    "This polygon shapefile represents areas of important farmland in Mariposa County, California for 2000. Established in 1982, Government Code Section 65570 mandates FMMP to biennially report on the conversion of farmland and grazing land, and to provide maps and data to local government and the public.",
    "The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP) provides data to decision makers for use in planning for the present and future use of California's agricultural land resources. The data is a current inventory of agricultural resources. This data is for general planning purposes and has a minimum mapping unit of ten acres.",
    "The Important Farmland survey area is based on Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) modern soil surveys covering most non-governmental lands in California; 49 counties are fully or partially surveyed at this time. Soil surveys specific to National Forests or other government land units are not surveyed. Beginning in 2000, SSURGO digital soil information was incorporated into the Alameda County Important Farmland data. Data subsequent to 2000 may have acreage and soil line differences due to incorporation of newer NRCS-SSURGO editions. \nPrior to the availability of SSURGO, soil information was hand-transferred from the paper soil surveys. Older versions of the data have not been modified. The land use minimum mapping unit of ten acres has not changed, but digital soil units of down to one acre occur in the SSURGO-enhanced Important Farmland data. Due to the interaction of land use and soil components of the data, incorporation of SSURGO may also result in units of less than ten acres for categories such as Other Land (or Nonagricultural and Natural Vegetation). For more information on SSURGO, contact the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service: <http://www.nrcs.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/soils/survey/geo/>",
