    "Bird’s eye view of Valletta and the Three Cities, showing what are probably Lancis’ fortification works at Valletta. From Civitates Orbis Terrarum, Braun and Hogenburg, Cologne, 1572. The material for the “Civitates”, probably the largest collection of city views ever published, was collected by Georg Braun and engraved by Franz Hogenberg. In the “Civitates”, Malta is a quarter-sheet, sharing the page with Famagusta, Rhodes, and Colaris. Malta is in the lower right-hand corner of a sheet showing a knight in armor praying before Christ on the cross. A family tree for five generations is shown with space for 31 coats of arms behind the cross."
