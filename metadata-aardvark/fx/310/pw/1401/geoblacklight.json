    "The Bathymetry of North America map layer shows depth ranges using colors. The image was derived from the National Geophysical Data Center's ETOPO2 elevation data, which is an elevation database gridded at 2-minute resolution, containing elevation and bathymetry for the world. The image was produced from the October 2001 data set. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States.",
    "The bathymetry image was developed to portray ocean depths around North America. This image is intended for visual purposes only. The original ETOPO2 data must be used for conducting analysis and determining specific bathymetric values.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
