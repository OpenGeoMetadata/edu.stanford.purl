    "Processing for much of the Single Family FHA mortgages is centralized into one of four Homeownership Centers (HOC) located in  Atlanta, Philadelphia, Denver, and Santa Ana; each supporting specific geographic region. Although most questions are handled by the FHA Resource Center (not the HOC) for immediate acknowledgement and tracking, certain case specific issues will subsequently be referred to the appropriate center.     To learn more about Homeownership Centers (HOC) visit: https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/sfhhocs",
