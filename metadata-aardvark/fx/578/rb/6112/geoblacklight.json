  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile represents reservoir protections areas in the County of Santa Cruz, California as defined in the Conservation and Open Space section of General Plan adopted May 24, 1994. Reservoir protection areas consist of the proposed water supply reservoir sites and areas within 1250 feet of the high water elevation of Reservoirs, as shown on the General Plan Resources and Constraints maps. For example, in the College Lake area, the area is defined as 1250 foot offset from the Proposed Reservoir, not crossing Highway 152, not crossing Holohan, not entering the USL and not affecting the Fairgrounds. Development activities are limited within Proposed reservoir protection areas. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California.",
    "The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. The GIS Unit serves all County departments and external customers and provides data on land, features and people of Santa Cruz County. Santa Cruz County encompasses 4 cities and approximately 265,000 people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
    "These data were compiled from many different sources; therefore, the accuracy of the individual layers varies significantly, and some layers do not align exactly with others. In the urban areas, data are generally accurate within five to ten feet of their true geographic coordinates, but in the rural areas, data may be accurate to only within three hundred feet. With these limitations, the County of Santa Cruz disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy or correctness of this data. This disclaimer is exclusive and in lieu of any warranties, fitness for particular purpose, and/or any other type of warranty, whether expressed or implied.",
