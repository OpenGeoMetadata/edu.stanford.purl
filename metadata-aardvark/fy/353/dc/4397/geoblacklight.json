    "This polygon shapefile contains land use and landcover data for the Russian River watershed in California. These data were derived from data originally collected by the USGS and converted to ARC/INFO by the EPA.",
    "This layer can be used for environmental assessment of land use patterns with respect to water quality analysis, growth management, and other types of environmental impact assessment in the Russian River region of California. Data are meant to be used by quadrangle, or among adjacent quadrangles where temporally contiguous. Can be used in any geographic application where intermediate scale land use data are appropriate and the dates are representative.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
