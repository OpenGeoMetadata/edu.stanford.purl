    "Metellus' Asian atlas complete, 12 maps; Metellus' African atlas includes 7 maps; the 162 maps of Europe have no title pg and are an organized blend of Itinerarium orbis Christiani and Metellus maps. The order of maps follows Meurer's MET 6 EVROPA (with title pg) (p183-5) very closely, i.e. the IOC maps included are sandwiched in precisely where Metel maps are missing, making for an equally comprehensive coverage of Europe as Met 6."
