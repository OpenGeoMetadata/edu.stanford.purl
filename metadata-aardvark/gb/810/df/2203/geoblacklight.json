    "The Northeast Recreational Boater Activities Layer depicts activity points plotted by participants in the 2012 Northeast Recreational Boater Survey, which was conducted by SeaPlan, the Northeast Regional Ocean Council (NROC), statesâ€™ coastal agencies, marine trade associations composed of many private industry representatives, and the First Coast Guard District. Boaters were able to identify locations where they partook in specific activities related to recreational boating, such as fishing, wildlife viewing, SCUBA diving, and swimming. The methodology for the 2012 Northeast Recreational Boater Survey follows a protocol similar to the 2010 Massachusetts Survey with modifications based on the lessons learned and recommendations suggested in the Massachusetts Survey Final Report. The methodology consists of surveying a random sample of selected boat owners throughout the Northeast through a series of monthly online surveys. The surveying period lasted throughout the 2012 boating season (May 1 through October 31, 2012), which was identified by the advisory committee (consisting of NROC and representatives from the recreational boating industry).
