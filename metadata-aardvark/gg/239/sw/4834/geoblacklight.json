    "Collector's note: Upper California runs east to the Rockies, but New Mexico runs to the Colorado River and so takes a chunk out of the usual representations of Upper California. Terreins Auriféres is indicated. The only towns in the Central Valley are Nle. Helvetia, Sacramento, and Sutterville. Curiously Los Angeles is not shown in the south.Along a dotted line running from the Gila River to Paso del Norte are the words Traite de 1848. The western boundary of Texas is shown running north from El Paso but keeping east of the Rio Grande. The locations of many Indian Tribes are shown. A large swath of territory east of the Rockies is labled Territoire Indiens."
