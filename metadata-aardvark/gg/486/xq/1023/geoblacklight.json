  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile contains area designations of hydrogen sulfide levels in California as required under Health and Safety Code section 39608. The designations are consistent with the criteria established in the California Code of Regulations, title 17, sections 70300 through 70306, and Appendices 1 through 3, thereof. There are four possible designation categories: attainment, nonattainment, nonattainment-transitional, and unclassified. Nonattainment areas are geographic areas which have not met National Ambient Air Quality Standards for hydrogen sulfide air pollution. The State area designations are reviewed annually and approved by the State Air Resources Board. Projection: Teale Albers, NAD83",
    "This shapefile can be used to identify hydrogen sulfide pollution area designations from the prior three-year period (2008-2011) in accordance with the California State Ambient Air Quality Standard.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
