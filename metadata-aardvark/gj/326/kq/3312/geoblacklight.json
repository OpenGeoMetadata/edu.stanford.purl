    "County Faults/Fault Zones (Per Riverside County General Plan 10/2003) Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones have been designated by the California Division of Mines and Geology for the Elsinore, San Jacinto, and San Andreas fault zones in Riverside County. Within the rapidly growing county, State A-P mapping has not kept pace with development. The County of Riverside has zoned fault systems and required similar special studies prior to development. These are referred to as County Fault Zones on Figure S-2 and in the Technical Background Report. Within A-P and County Fault Zones, proposed tracts of four or more dwelling units must investigate the potential for and setback from ground rupture hazards. As there are many active faults in Riverside County, with new fault strands being continually discovered, all proposed structures designed for human occupancy should be required to investigate the potential for and setback from ground rupture. Also of concern are structures, not for human occupancy, that can cause harm if damaged by an earthquake, such as utility, communications, and transportation lifelines. The County regulates most development projects within earthquake fault zones (Figure S-2). Projects include all land divisions and most structures for human occupancy. Before a project can be permitted within an A-P Earthquake Fault Zone, County Fault Zone, or within 150 feet of any other potentially active or active fault mapped in published United States Geological Survey (USGS) or California Division of Mining and Geology (CDMG) reports, a geologic investigation must demonstrate that proposed buildings will not be constructed across active faults.Updated 2/2016 with Thermal and Indio California Geologic Survey Quads",
