    "This feature service denotes the locations of HUD assisted Multi-Family properties that primarily serve disabled residents. In addition, each property illustrated through this service has at least one active Service Coordinator contract or grant, Section 8 New Construction contract, Section 811 Project Assistance Contracts (PAC) contract, or Section 811 Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC).  Please note that the data provided through this service only includes location data and attributes for those addresses that can be geocoded to an interpolated point along a street segment, or to a ZIP+4 centroid location. While not all records are able to be geocoded and mapped, we are continuously working to improve the address data quality and enhance coverage. Please consider this issue when using any datasets provided by HUD.
