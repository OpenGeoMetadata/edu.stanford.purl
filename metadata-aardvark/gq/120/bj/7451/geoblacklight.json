    "The jobs proximity index quantifies the\naccessibility of a given residential neighborhood as a function of its distance\nto all job locations within a CBSA, with larger employment centers weighted\nmore heavily. Specifically, a gravity model is used, where the accessibility\n(Ai) of a given residential block- group is a summary description of the\ndistance to all job locations, with the distance from any single job location\npositively weighted by the size of employment (job opportunities) at that\nlocation and inversely weighted by the labor supply (competition) to that\nlocation. More formally, the model has the following specification:     Where i\nindexes a given residential block-group, and j indexes all n block groups\nwithin a CBSA. Distance, d, is measured as “as the crow flies” between\nblock-groups i and j, with distances less than 1 mile set equal to 1. E\nrepresents the number of jobs in block-group j, and L is the number of workers\nin block-group j.   The Longitudinal\nEmployer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) has missing jobs data in all of Puerto Rico\nand a concentration of missing records in Massachusetts.   Interpretation Values are percentile ranked with values\nranging from 0 to 100. The higher the index value, the better the access to\nemployment opportunities for residents in a neighborhood. Data Source: Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, 2014. Related AFFH-T Local Government, PHA and State Tables/Maps: Table 12; Map 8. To learn more about the Jobs Proximity Index visit: https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/4868/affh-raw-data/ Date of Coverage: 02/2020",
