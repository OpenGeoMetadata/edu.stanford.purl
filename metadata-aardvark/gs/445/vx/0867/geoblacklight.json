    "The Local Employment Dynamics (LED) Partnership is a voluntary federal-state enterprise created for the purpose of merging employee, and employer data to provide a set of enhanced labor market statistics known collectively as Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI). The QWI are a set of economic indicators including employment, job creation, earnings, and other measures of employment flows.\nFor the purposes of this dataset, LED data for 2018 is aggregated to Census Summary Level 070 (State + County + County Subdivision + Place/Remainder), and joined with the Home Investment Partnership (HOME) Program  grantee areas spatial dataset for FY2018.\nAuthorized under Title II of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, the HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME) is designed exclusively to create affordable housing for low-income households. Each year the HOME Program allocates approximately $2 billion to fund the development, purchase, or rehabilitation of affordable housing, and to provide direct rental assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that this version of the data does not include Community Planning and Development (CPD) entitlement grantees.
