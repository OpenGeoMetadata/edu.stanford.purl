  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile portrays floodplains and valley bottoms in Kenya. These data were extracted from FAO's Africover 2000 landform dataset. Floodplains consist of land adjacent to a river channel that is seasonally covered by river water. Areas that experienced the most flooding are the shores of Lake Victoria in western Kenya, the banks of the Tana River in eastern Kenya, and the Lorian Swamp in central eastern Kenya, all highlighted on the map. Although the flooding near Lake Victoria does not appear to be extensive from this national map, it is important to understand that population density in that area is high and thus flooding is very destructive",
    "This data was used in Map 3.14 and Map 3.15 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being.",
