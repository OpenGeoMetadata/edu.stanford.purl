    "Illustrates the geo-political boundary changes following the Treaty of Fredrikshamm, a peace agreement concluded between Sweden and Russia on September 17, 1809. The treaty ended the Finnish War and had Sweden cede parts of Lappland and Vasterbotten, Aland, and all provinces east of it. These territories came to make up the Grand Duchy of Finland and lead to the revival of Finnish culture, an equal position for the Finnish language, and ultimately Finland's independence after the Russian Revolution in 1917. This map gives a larger regional context, showing the eastern limits of the Russian Empire and its neighbors--the Ottoman Empire, Wallachia, Moldova, Galicia, Poland, and the Persian Empire.",
