    "This line shapefile represents the maritime limits of California. NOAA's Office of Coast Survey (OCS) is responsible for generating the 3 Nautical Mile Line, Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Traditionally, these maritime limits have been generated by hand from the low water line depicted on paper and United States nautical charts. Upon final approval by the United States Baseline Committee, these legally-binding maritime limits are applied to the next edition of nautical charts produced by the Marine Chart Division of OCS. Due to new cartographic production processes and the availability of digital products such as Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs), OCS has developed improved techniques for generating more accurate, digital maritime limits.",
    "This coverage can be used as a source for depiction of maritime limits on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) paper nautical charts and electronic navigational charts. The maritime limits were constructed from baseline points that represent the most seaward, drying features at mean lower low water on NOAA's largest scale, latest edition, paper nautical charts of the area. These digital boundaries do NOT represent the legal depiction of maritime limits.",
