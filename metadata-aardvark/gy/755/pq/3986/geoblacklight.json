    "This polygon shapefile depicts the townships, ranges and sections contained in the Public Land Survey System grid for the State of California. Townships are roughly six miles square, and are numbered north and south from an established baseline. Likewise, ranges are numbered east and west from an established meridian.",
    "This layer can be of help in defining position and scale on small-scale plots and locating other features by means of township/range/section identifiers.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
