  "dct_description_sm": [
    "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) periodically receives &quot;custom tabulations&quot; of Census data from the U.S. Census Bureau that are largely not available through standard Census products. These datasets, known as &quot;CHAS&quot; (Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy) data, demonstrate the extent of housing problems and housing needs, particularly for low income households. The primary purpose of CHAS data is to demonstrate the number of households in need of housing assistance. This is estimated by the number of households that have certain housing problems and have income low enough to qualify for HUD’s programs (primarily 30, 50, and 80 percent of median income). CHAS data provides counts of the numbers of households that fit these HUD-specified characteristics in a variety of geographic areas. In addition to estimating low-income housing needs, CHAS data contributes to a more comprehensive market analysis by documenting issues like lead paint risks, &quot;affordability mismatch,&quot; and the interaction of affordability with variables like age of homes, number of bedrooms, and type of building.This dataset is a special tabulation of the 2013-2017 American Community Survey (ACS) and reflects conditions over that time period. The data set uses custom HUD Area Median Family Income (HAMFI) figures calculated by HUD PDR staff based on 2013-2017 ACS income data. CHAS datasets are used by Federal, State, and Local governments to plan how to spend, and distribute HUD program funds. To learn more about the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy To learn more about the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), visit: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/cp.html To learn more about the American Community Survey (ACS), and associated datasets visit: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs  Data Dictionary: DD_ACS 5-Year CHAS Estimate Data by County Date of Coverage: 2013-2017",
