    "This point shapefile depicts physical information on commercial facilities at the principal United States coastal, Great Lakes and inland ports. The data consists of listings of port area waterfront facilities, including information on berthing, cranes, transit sheds, grain elevators, marine repair plants, fleeting areas, and docking and storage facilities. Collection of data is performed on a rotational basis to ensure on-site accuracy at each facility. This layer is part of the 2014 National Transportation Atlas Database.",
    "The National Transportation Atlas Databases 2014 (NTAD2014) is a set of nationwide geographic datasets of transportation facilities, transportation networks, associated infrastructure and other political and administrative entities. These datasets include spatial information for transportation modal networks and intermodal terminals, as well as the reÂ¬lated attribute information for these features. This data supports research, analysis, and decision-making across all transportation modes. It is most useful at the national level, but has major applications at regional, state and local scales throughout the transportation community. The data used to compile NTAD2014 was provided by our partners within the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and by other agencies throughout the United States Federal Government. These contributors are the actual data stewards and are ultimately responsible for the maintenance and accuracy of their data. The Navigation Data Center (NDC) had several objectives in developing the United States Waterway Data. These objectives support the concept of a National Spatial Data Infrastructure to: provide public access to national waterway data; foster inter-agency and intra-agency cooperation through data sharing; provide a mechanism to integrate waterway data (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Port/Facility and U.S. Coast Guard Accident Data, for example); provide a basis for intermodal analysis; assist standardization of waterway entity definitions (Ports/Facilities, Locks, etc.); provide public access to the National Waterway Network  which can be used as a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data such as waterway and modal network/facility databases; and provide reliable data to support future waterway and intermodal applications."
