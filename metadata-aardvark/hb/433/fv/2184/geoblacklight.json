  "dct_description_sm": [
    "Lists U.S. counties designated as Low Vacancy Areas for the purposes of the Tenant-Protection Vouchers (TPV) program set-aside for low-vacancy areas.The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) identifies low-vacancy areas for purposes of funding the Tenant Protection Vouchers (TPVs) set-aside for certain at-risk households in low-vacancy areas. The Department has set low-vacancy areas at the county level.Low-vacancy areas are set at the county level using occupancy rates for public housing and multifamily assisted properties. Occupancy data at the project level are obtained from the most recent Picture of Subsidized Households Report. For the purposes of the TPV set-aside, a low-vacancy area is defined to be an area with an occupancy rate for public housing and multifamily assisted properties greater than or equal to 90 percent.To ensure that vacancy rates are only counted for high quality units, the occupancy data is matched to the most recent Physical Inspection Scores data for both public housing and multifamily assisted properties. Properties with inspection scores below 60 are removed from the sample, as are properties that are missing inspection scores or occupancy rates.Project-level data is aggregated to the county level, and the total occupancy rate for each county is calculated. County-level occupancy rates are used for the determination of eligibility for TPV set-aside funding as long as at least ten units of public housing and multifamily assisted housing are included in the dataset.-       Counties within a Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) that have less than ten units use the CBSA-level occupancy rates.-       Counties outside of CBSAs with less than ten units use state-wide non-CBSA totals to calculate occupancy rates.-       Counties in states with only CBSA counties or a state non-CBSA unit count below ten use national non-CBSA occupancy rates.To learn more about Low Vacancy Areas visit : https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/lowvactpv.htmlDate of Coverage: Jun 30, 2022 - Jul 1, 2023Data Dictionary: DD_Low Vacancy Areas - Set-Aside Tenant Protection Voucher",
