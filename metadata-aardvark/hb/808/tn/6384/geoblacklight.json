  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This raster dataset is a 2-meter slope grid containing multibeam bathymetry data for the northern section of North Monterey Bay, California collected from a USGS Western Coastal &amp; Marine Geology survey of the Monterey Bay area from Año Nuevo to Moss Landing. These data were acquired between August 13- September 3, 2009 (field activity S-7-09-MB), from Point Año Nuevo south to Table Rock, as well as a block west of Soquel Canyon; and between October 12 - December 16, 2009 (field activity S-10-09-MB), surveying between Table Rock and Moss Landing. Habitat analyses and final products derived from multibeam bathymetry data were handled by the Seafloor Mapping Lab at CSUMB. This layer was created as part of the California Seafloor Mapping Project.",
    "Marine data offered here represent the efforts of a comprehensive state waters mapping program for California launched by the California State Coastal Conservancy, Ocean Protection Council, Department of Fish and Game, and the NOAA National Marine Sanctuary Program. The ultimate goal is the creation of a high-resolution 1:24,000 scale geologic and habitat base map series covering all of California's 14,500 km2 state waters out to the 3 mile limit, and support of the state's Marine Life Protection Act Initiative (MLPA) goal to create a statewide network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This statewide project requires, involves and leverages expertise from industry, resource management agencies and academia. The tiered mapping campaign involves the use of state-of-the-art sonar, LIDAR (aerial laser) and video seafloor mapping technologies; computer aided classification and visualization; expert geologic and habitat interpretations codified into strip maps spanning California's land/sea boundary; and the creation of an online, publicly accessible data repository for the dissemination of all mapping products.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
