    "Moving to Work (MTW) is a demonstration program for public housing authorities (PHAs) that provides  the opportunity to design and test innovative, locally designed strategies that use Federal dollars more efficiently, help residents find employment and become self-sufficient, and increase housing choices for low-income families. MTW allows PHAs exemptions from many existing public housing and voucher rules and provides funding flexibility with how they use their Federal funds. PHAs in the MTW demonstration have pioneered a number of innovative policy interventions that have been proven to be successful at the local level, and subsequently rolled out to the rest of the country’s PHAs. Currently, there are 39 MTW PHAs nationwide and HUD plans to expand the program to addition 100 PHAs by 2022.    This feature service provides location data for PHA administrative offices of housing authorities participating in the Morving to Work demonstration program, and that data is derivied from from HUD's enterprise geocoding service.    Please note that, for the purposes of the Moving to Work demonstration program, AK001 and AK901 are counted as single organization as are CA056 and CA059.
