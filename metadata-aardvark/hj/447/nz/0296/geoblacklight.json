    "This polygon shapefile depicts the kelp canopy for the coastal area seaward of Hopkins Marine Station, located in Pacific Grove, California. This file was created to assess the extents of Giant (Macrocystis pyrifera) and Bull (Nereocystis leutkeana) Kelp along the coast of California. The original imagery was collected using a Digital Multi-Spectral Video unit developed by Specterra Systems Inc.",
    "These data are used to assess the extent of kelp resources along the coast of California.",
