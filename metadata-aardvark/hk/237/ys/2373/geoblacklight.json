  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This raster dataset is a 1-degree digital elevation model containing shaded surface relief (hillshade) bathymetry data for Monterey Bay, California. These data were produced from the USGS 1-degree DEM of Monterey Bay, California (1994). These grids are provided in GCS WGS 84 and UTM Zone 10 (NAD 83) projections. This layer is part of the GIS Data of the Monterey Bay collection, a compilation of data and imagery of the Monterey Bay area, including coastline, imagery, and bathymetry.",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. This collection of data provides documented layers of of the Monterey Bay to persons/institutions of interest throughout the research and educational communities."
