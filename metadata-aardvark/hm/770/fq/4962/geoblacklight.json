    "Topographic map of the region around Cape Merkus including some of the Arawe Islands off the southwestern coast of New Britain, now administered by Papua New Guinea. Both maps feature a lot of contour-like areas marked 'cloud' in Japanese obscuring some of the topographic detail. Map no. 1 shows Arawe as the westernmost point on this map. But this is incorrect as the area marked Arawe is in fact Cape Ainto made up of a number of settlements. Arawe is actually further to the west off Cape Merkus [not shown on this map]. The easternmost point on this map is Cape Pasuwati. The town of Murien is shown northwest from this cape and further up an unnamed river [that is, the Pulie River]. Map no. 2 clearly shows Cape Merkus as the southernmost point marked on the map. Just above this area, the map shows two intersecting lines marked in Japanese 'photograph is missing', indicating why the area west of Cape Merkus is blank. Thus the map omits Arawe Island directly west of Cape Merkus, Kumbum Island and Ausak Island. The remaining Arawe Islands are shown northwest of Cape Merkus but unnamed. Relief shown by form lines and spot heights.",
