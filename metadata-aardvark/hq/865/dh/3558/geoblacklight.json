    "This line shapefile represents interstate routes in California existing intercity passenger rail system. Intercity passenger rail services provide transportation between metropolitan areas, to rural areas of California, and to points beyond California’s borders. California’s intercity rail services can be divided into two groups: 1) state-supported routes, which are funded by the State and serve California travel markets; and 2) Amtrak long-distance routes, which are funded by Amtrak and serve California and interstate markets. This feature class includes four Amtrak long-distance intercity passenger rail routes in California: California Zephyr (Emeryville – Sacramento – Reno – Denver – Chicago), Coast Starlight (Los Angeles – Oakland – Sacramento – Portland – Seattle), Sunset Limited (Los Angeles-San Antonio-New Orleans), and Southwest Chief (Los Angeles – Albuquerque – Kansas City – Chicago). ). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).",
