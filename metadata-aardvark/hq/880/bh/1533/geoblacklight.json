  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This raster dataset provides bathymetry information at a resolution of 90 meters for New England- from coastal regions to the edge of the continental shelf. Inland regions are included in this dataset as well as freshwater hydrological systems that are contained within a bounding area for New Enlgand. This product is from the National Geophysical Data Center's (NGDC) U.S. Coastal Relief Model (CRM), which provides the first comprehensive view of the U.S. coastal zone integrating offshore bathymetry with land topography into a seamless representation of the coast. The CRM spans the U.S. East and West Coasts, the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii, reaching out to, and in places even beyond, the continental slope. Bathymetric and topographic data sources include: NGDC's NOS hydrographic surveys, multibeam bathymetry, and trackline bathymetry; the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); and other federal government agencies and academic institutions. Bathymetric contours from the International Bathymetric Chart of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico project were also used. Digital elevation models (DEMs) of the Great Lakes, Southern Alaska, and high-resolution DEMs of U.S. coastal communities and territories are also available.",
    "This layer provides bathymetry data from the coast of New England to the contintental shelf.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
