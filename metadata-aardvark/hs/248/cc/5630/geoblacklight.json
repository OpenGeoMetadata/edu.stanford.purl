    "A double hemisphere world map showing California as an island with a straight, relatively flat northern coast. The northwest coast of America slopes to the east, eventually connecting with an arctic land mass. The background is ornately drawn with two small insets: the sun as derived by Kircher (upper left) and the moon as drawn by Cassini (upper right). Below the map is a large table of geographical coordinates for the countries and regions shown. The letters in the table correspond to the letters in the border surrounding the map. The first “P” and “E” in the title word “MAPPEMONDE” are above the normal line of type, and are a smaller size. They may have been added later and suggest an earlier state exists."
