    "Grave Reform in Modern China is a digital humanities initiative based at Stanford that is building an interactive spatial and textual analysis platform to examine the phenomenon of grave relocation in modern China, a campaign that has led to the exhumation and reburial of 10 million corpses in the past decade alone, and has transformed Chinaâ€™s graveyards into sites of acute personal, social, political, and economic contestation."
