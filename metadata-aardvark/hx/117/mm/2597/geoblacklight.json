    "This polygon shapefile shows rangelands within Kenya. These data are originally from FAO's Africover dataset (2000). Kenya’s semi-arid and arid rangelands cover more than 80 percent of its land area, corresponding closely to Kenya’s lowest human population densities and higher livestock densities.",
    "This data was used in Map 1.3 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being.",
    "Data set is not for use in litigation.
