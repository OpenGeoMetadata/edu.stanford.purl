    "This point shapefile identifies 194 marine and inland port locations used by marine fisheries for the landing and sale of fish and invertebrates. Each port has a code identifier which is linked to fishery landings at that port. The code is referenced in several fishery datasets owned and managed by the Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
    "Port identification and location is used to analyze and map marine fishery activities by geographic region throughout California.",
