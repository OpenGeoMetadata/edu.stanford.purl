    "The Satellite View of the Conterminous United States, with Shaded Relief map layer is a 200-meter-resolution simulated-natural-color image of the United States, delivered in the Albers Equal-Area Conic map projection. Vegetation is generally green, with forests in darker green and grasslands or shrublands in lighter green. Areas of high reflectance, including urban areas, rock, and dry bare soil, are shown in shades of pink. Very bright areas, such as snow and ice, are colored blue. The image was produced by combining Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery from the Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 satellites with relief enhanced by shading. This map layer was previously distributed as Satellite View of the Conterminous United States. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition National Atlas of the United States.",
    "The Satellite View with Shaded Relief image was developed to portray the terrain and land cover of the conterminous United States. The image is intended for visual purposes only. The original Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and National Elevation Dataset (NED) data must be used for conducting analysis.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
