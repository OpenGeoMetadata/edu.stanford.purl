    "This layer is a georeferenced image of a map of Shanghai (originally titled '最新上海地圖 /Saishin Shanhai chizu ') that was published in 1932. It is a map of Shanghai, China made after the close of the Sino-Japanese incident in the winter of 1931-1932. Printed in the 12th year of Hirohito's reign, it depicts downtown Shanghai including the Chinese municipality, the French Concession, the International Settlement etc. Important buildings along the Bund are carefully noted, including the first HSBC Bank, the British Club, the Peace Hotel, and the Customs House. There is also a panoramic photo of the Bund along the bottom of the map. There are two small inset maps of Nanking and Central China also on the map. Most of the text is written in both Japanese and English.",
    "Virtual Shanghai is a research and resource platform on the history of Shanghai from the mid-nineteenth century to nowadays. It incorporates various sets of documents: essays, original documents, photographs, maps, quantitative data, etc. The objective of the project is to write a history of the city through the combined mobilization of these various types of documents. The implementation of this approach relies on the use of digital and GIS technologies. On the research side, the platform offers various ways to step into the history of the city and follow its course at different levels over time. On the resource side, apart from providing original textual and visual documents, it develops a powerful cartographic tool for spatial analysis and real-time mapping. The authors of the present project subscribe to the idea of sharing scholarship and research tools for the benefit of scholars, students, and citizens at large.",
