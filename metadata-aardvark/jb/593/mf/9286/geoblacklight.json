    "This polygon shapefile depicts oceans split into contiguous pieces. These data are derived from the 10m ocean coastline data. Ocean polygon is the same as Bathymetry 0 (sea level). This theme (and its inverse cousin, Land) are used to clip the raster imagery. These data are represented at 1:50,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0).",
    "Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software."
