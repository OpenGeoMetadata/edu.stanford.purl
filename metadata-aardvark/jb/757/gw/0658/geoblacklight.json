    "This line shapefile displays graticules (grid lines of latitude parallels and longitude meridians) for the world at 1 degree intervals. Graticules include 180-degree east and west meridians (consider deleting one of these to avoid duplicate lines). This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0). Scale:110,000,000.",
    "Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software."
