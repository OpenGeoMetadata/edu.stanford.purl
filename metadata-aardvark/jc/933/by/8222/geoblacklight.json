  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This point shapefile depicts point labels of major physical features worldwide, including capes, islands, and waterfalls. The boundaries of physical regions are roughly accurate to 50m scale, although the number of features included is to the 10m scale. Data was derived primarily from the Florida Resources and Environmental Analysis Center's Physical Map of the World. Do not edit this theme. Instead, edit the 10m version and select based on \"Scale Rank\" &lt;= 3 and export to make this 110m theme. These data are represented at 1:110,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0).",
    "Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software."
