  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile represents the coastal area of 1 nautical mile distance form the California shoreline. This layer was created by extracting and then buffering the coastline from the Teale Data Center ARC/INFO County coverage (equivalent to USGS 1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph) to 1 international nautical mile (1852 meters). The north and south ends of the polygon were closed with arcs extracted from the Dept. of Fish and Game's caltrawl coverage. San Francisco Bay is not included in the polygon. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Deparmtent of Fish &amp; Game.",
    "This layer can be used to identify coastal area within 1 nm of the shoreline.",
    "As appropriate for data quality. Not for navigation.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
