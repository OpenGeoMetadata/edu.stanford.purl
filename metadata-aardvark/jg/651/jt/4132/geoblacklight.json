    "This line shapefile comprises the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) maps for the shoreline of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. ESI data characterize marine and estuarine environments and wildlife by their sensitivity to spilled oil. The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats; sensitive biological resources; and human-use resources. This dataset shows classified shorelines habitats and was derived from three separate ESI polygon feature datasets for the region. A coded domain identifes the shoreline types for the ESI classification values. Shoreline types include exposed rocky cliffs, exposed man-made solid structures, exposed wave cut platforms in bedrock, exposed scarps and slopes in clay, fine-medium grain sand beaches, scarps and steep slopes in sand, coarse grained sand beaches, mixed sand and gravel beaches, gravel beaches, riprap, exposed tidal flats, sheltered rocky shores, sheltered solid man-made structures, sheltered riprap, vegetated steeply sloping bluffs, sheltered tidal flats, vegetated low banks, salt and brackish water marsh, freshwater marshes, freshwater swamp, and scrub-shrub wetlands.",
    "The ESI data were collected, mapped, and digitized to provide environmental data for oil spill planning and response. The Clean Water Act with amendments by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires response plans for immediate and effective protection of sensitive resources.",
    "DO NOT USE ESI MAPS FOR NAVIGATIONAL PURPOSES. Besides the above warning, there are no use constraints on these data. Acknowledgment of the publishers and contributing sources listed in 1.11. would be appreciated in products derived from these data.",
