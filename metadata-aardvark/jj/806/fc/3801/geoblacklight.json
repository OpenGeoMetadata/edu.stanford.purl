    "The LandScan Global Population Database (2011) contains population counts at 30 arc second resolution (1 km. or finer). \"Using an innovative approach with Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing, ORNL's LandScanâ„¢ is the community standard for global population distribution. At approximately 1 km resolution (30\" X 30\"), LandScan is the finest resolution global population distribution data available and represents an ambient population (average over 24 hours). The LandScan algorithm, an R&amp;D 100 Award Winner, uses spatial data and imagery analysis technologies and a multi-variable dasymetric modeling approach to disaggregate census counts within an administrative boundary. Since no single population distribution model can account for the differences in spatial data availability, quality, scale, and accuracy as well as the differences in cultural settlement practices, LandScan population distribution models are tailored to match the data conditions and geographical nature of each individual country and region.\" --from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory LandScan Web site, Sept. 20, 2012. There is also a layer file (lspop2011.lyr) for ArcGIS. This dataset is part of the LandScan 2011 Global Population Database.",
    "The LandScan Global Population Database was developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). This dataset allows for quick and easy assessment, estimation, and visualization of populations-at-risk."
