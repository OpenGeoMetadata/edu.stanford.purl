    "Fire Threat is a combination of two factors: 1) fire probability, or the likelihood of a given area burning, and 2) potential fire behavior (hazard). These two factors are combined to create 5 threat classes ranging from low to extreme. This version (fthrt14_2) is an update created from fthrt14_1 (created for the FRAP 2017 Forest and Rangeland Assessment). Fire Rotation data in fthrt14_1 was replaced with Annual Fire Probability data developed for California by Pyrologix Inc. Fire Threat provides a measure of fuel conditions and fire potential in the ecosystem, representing the relative likelihood of “damaging” or difficult to control wildfire occurring for a given area. Fire Threat is not a risk assessment by itself, but can be used to assess the potential for impacts on various assets and values susceptible to fire. Impacts are more likely to occur and/or be of increased severiety for the higher threat classes.",
