    "This raster dataset is a 200-meter resolution grid containing multibeam bathymetry data for Monterey Bay, California. These data are provided in GCS WGS 84 and UTM Zone 10 (NAD 83) projections, as well as Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) and ASCII formats. This layer is part of the GIS Data of the Monterey Bay collection, a compilation of data and imagery of the Monterey Bay area, including coastline, imagery, and bathymetry.",
    "This collection of data provides documented layers of of the Monterey Bay to persons/institutions of interest throughout the research and educational communities. These maps help define the geological variability of the seafloor and provide a detailed framework for future research, monitoring, and management activities."
