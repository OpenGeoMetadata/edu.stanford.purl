    "This point shapefile depicts locations and facilities of the beach access points and coastal features of interest documented by the California Coastal Access Guide (2003) and the more detailed Experience the California Coast (ETCC) coastal access guidebook series Volumes 1- Del Norte through Marin Counties (2005) and Volume 3- Monterey through Ventura Counties (2007). Point Loma Ecological Reserve point was deleted and Cabrillo National Monument point was moved to the parking lot for tidepoolers per South Coast Regional Profile Map Comments in 2009. The point locations and attributes contained in these data are as accurate as this source material. The points and attributes attached should be used for planning purposes only. The data are projected in California Teale Albers using North American Datum 1983.",
    "This dataset provides feature coverage for coastal recreational attributes, such as parking, visitor centers, restrooms, picnic areas, fire pits, campgrounds, boat ramps, kayaking, and diving.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
