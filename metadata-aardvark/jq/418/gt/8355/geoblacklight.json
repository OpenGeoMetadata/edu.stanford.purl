    "This line shapefile represents the roads within the Russian River Watershed boundaries of California. These data were extracted from a layer titles 'Major Roads of California' (1997). Line features selected from the original source data were based on their spatial location within the extent of the Russian River basin.",
    "The intended purpose of this dataset is to provide users with a line feature type data layer at 1:100,000 scale that describes and illustrates the roads contained within the extent of the Russian River basin.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
