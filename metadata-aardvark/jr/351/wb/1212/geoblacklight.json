Title cartouche is surrounded by rain clouds, drowned people and animals, and an inset drawing of Noah’s Ark. At bottom center is a large stone wall engraved with the key to the numbers on the map: Europa, 1-27; Asia, 28-30; Africa, 31-39; and America, 40-50. Virginia is number 41. Typically bound into the front of Dutch bibles with four other maps of the Holy Lands."
