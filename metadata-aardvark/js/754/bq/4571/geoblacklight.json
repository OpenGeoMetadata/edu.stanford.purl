    "This polygon shapefile describes the landuse and landcover of the Mendocino Reach of the Russian River in 1940. The Mendocino Reach extent is defined by the Hopland, Hwy. 101 Bridge and the town of Calpella, Mendocino County, California. This dataset is one of six datasets that together, form the GIS data for the Russian River Resource Enhancement Plan and Public Access Plan (Enhancement Plan)",
