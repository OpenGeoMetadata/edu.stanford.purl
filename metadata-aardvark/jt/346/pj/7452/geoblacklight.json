    "This polygon shapefile represents adjusted urban area boundaries for California derived from the 2010 Census urban area boundaries, the preceding 2000 Caltrans urban area boundaries, and approved district and headquarters urban area adjustments. The three urban area boundaries were merged and smoothed to create the 170 adjusted urban area boundaries for California. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).",
    "The 2010 adjusted urban area file represents the current Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approved Caltrans adjusted urban area boundaries in California.",

There are no restrictions on distribution of the data by users. However, users are encouraged to refer others to the Department of Transportationâ€™s GIS Data Library to acquire the data, in case updated data become available.",
