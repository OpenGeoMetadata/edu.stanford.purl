    "This map illustrates satellite-detected, potentially damaged structures in some affected colonies located in Venustiano Carranza, Cuauhtemoc, Benito Juarez, Coyoacan and Iztapalapa Municipalities, Federal District, Mexico following the 19 September 2017 M7.1 earthquake. The analysis was performed by Faculty of Geography of the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico (UAEMex) using as post-event satellite imagery : WorldView-2 acquired as of 20 and 26 September 2017 and Pleiades acquired as of 22 September 2017. UAEMex identified 201 potentially damaged structures within the limit of the analyzed colonies, surrounded by a blue line in this map: 24 are located in Magdelena Mixhuca colony, 22 in Aculco, 21 in Atenor Sala and 20 in El Arenal.",
    "This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org to seek clarification.",
