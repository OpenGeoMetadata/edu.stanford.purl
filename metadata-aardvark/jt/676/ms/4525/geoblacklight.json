  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This point shapefile contains locations of existing small-scale irrigation and drainage points in Kenya. Clusters of small-scale irrigation points are especially prevalent around the shores of Lake Victoria and the base of Mount Kenya. The irrigated areas around the base of Mount Kenya depend mostly on water from the upper Tana and Ewaso Ngiro Rivers, which drain from the top of the mountain.",
