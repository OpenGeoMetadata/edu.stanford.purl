    "The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is an independent regulatory agency    that is not part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development    (HUD).      The FHFA was established by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA)  and is responsible for the effective supervision, regulation, and housing  mission oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac (the Enterprises), Common  Securitization Solutions, LLC (CSS), and the Federal Home Loan Bank System,  which includes the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) and the Office of  Finance. Since 2008, FHFA has also served as conservator of Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac.        Conforming Loan Limits are mortgage limits set annually (as required by HERA)    by the FHFA. In order for a mortgage loan to be eligible to be insured by    Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, the loan amount must be less than the loan limit.    Mortgage exceeding the Conforming Loan Limit are referred to as    &amp;quot;non-conforming loans&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;jumbo loans.&amp;quot; While most counties use a single set of Conforming Loan Limits based on the number of    units, high cost of living counties use higher Conforming Loan Limits. The    FHFA analyzes year-over-year change in average home prices in October of each    year using the Monthly Interest Rate Survey (MIRS) to adjust the Conforming    Loan Limits for the upcoming year.          Geospatial data in this feature service uses the Census 2010 County    geographies.
