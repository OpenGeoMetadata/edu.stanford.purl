    "The Temperature Severity Indicator data identifies areas subject to extreme heat and cold events in the contiguous United States in an effort to inform temperature-related housing and planning research. The indicators, conveyed as a grid of 1-degree latitude by 1-degree longitude cells, are created from observational data (Berkeley Earth Lab gridded daily maximum and minimum temperature ) and consider the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme heat and extreme cold weather events that occurred in the US between 1913 and 2012.DEFINING EXTREME TEMPERATURE EVENTS    For the purposes of this data, a    daytime extreme heat event is defined as daily maximum temperature (tmax) that    meets or exceeds the 90th percentile daily tmax for June, July, and    August (JJA) during the reference period 1961-1990 and lasting for at least 3    consecutive days. A lower bound is set to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (F) to define    the minimum temperature qualifying as a daytime heat event. Likewise, a night time extreme    heat event is defined as daily minimum temperature (tmin) that meets or exceeds    the 90th percentile daily tmin for JJA during the reference period    1961-1990 and lasting for at least 3 consecutive nights. A lower bound is set    to 75 F to define the minimum temperature qualifying as a night time heat    event.  A daytime extreme cold event is    defined as daily maximum temperature (tmax) that is at least 10 F less than the    median daily climatological January tmax over the reference period 1961-1990    and lasting for at least 3 consecutive days. An upper bound is set at 32 F to    define the maximum temperature qualifying as a daytime cold event, and a lower    bound is set to -10 F, where any 3 or more consecutives days colder than this    limit is considered a cold event. A night time extreme cold event    is defined as daily minimum temperature (tmin) that is at least 10 F less than    the median daily climatological January tmin over the reference period    1961-1990 and lasting for at least 3 consecutive days. An upper bound is set at    32 F to define the maximum temperature qualifying as a night time cold event,    and a lower bound is set to -10 F, where any 3 or more consecutives nights    colder than this limit is considered a cold event.CREATING EXTREME TEMPERATURE  SEVERITY INDEXES    The average annual event  frequency (events/yr), average event intensity compared to a seasonally  representative temperature (F), and the average event duration (days) are  computed using the Berkeley Earth temperature observations as well as the above  definitions for extreme heat and cold events. Results of those calculations are  classified according to a quartile distribution of all values  relative to attribute, and each cell receives a score according to its quartile class: 0  points for a cell value less than the 25th percentile, 1 point if between the  25th and 50th percentile, 2 points if between the 50th and 75th percentile, 3  points if greater than the 75th percentile. The index value represents the aggregation of quartile points awarded for each attribute of  a particular cell.SUGGESTED USE OF DATA  Fields ending with the suffix, “_INDX”  provide spatially relevant severity indices for min/max cold snaps and heat  waves. As described previously, the value for each index represents the  summation of attributes scores determined by a quartile distribution of all  values for each facet of analysis. Index scores for these fields range from 0  to 9 providing for a relatively smooth surface map illustrating spatial variability.    In contrast, fields ending with  the suffix, “_IND” are binary attributes that indicate areas where the index  values for both night-time (tmin) and day-time (tmax) is &amp;gt;= 5 relative to  each event type. Given the boolean nature of data in these fields they are best used to quickly identify areas of extreme temperature to answer policy related questions, and not necessarily for illustration or spatial analysis.Data Dictionary: DD_Temperature Severity IndexDate of Coverage: 1913 - 2013",
