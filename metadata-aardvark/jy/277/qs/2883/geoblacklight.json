  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile describes distributions of Chinook and Coho salmon and Steelehead and Coastal Cutthroat trout in the Russian River watershed up until 2002. The mapping unit used to describe fish distributions is the seventh field polygons from the CALWATER hydrologic sub-unit coverage. Please note that the disctinction between historic and current stopped in 1999.",
    "This shapefile is intended to be used for salmonid recovery planning, watershed planning and analysis at the 1:24,000 scale.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
