    "This polygon shapefile depicts hydrological, geological and paleontological resource areas in the County of Santa Cruz, California. These Areas stand out as rare or unique and representative in Santa Cruz County because of their scarcity, scientific or educational value and aesthetic quality or cultural significance. Identified Areas are: (a) Majors Creek Canyon: The cliffs and exposed rocks of this canyon to the east of Highway 1 are outstanding scenic features. (b) Martin Road: East and west of Martin Road, encompassed in the botanical sites, are unusual sandhill outcroppings. (c) Wilder Creek: This area contains a concentration of limestone caves worth protecting. (d) Table Rock: Highly scenic coastal rock formations (sedimentary intrusive bodies) can be found in the vicinity of Table Rock and Yellow Bank Creek. Areas are represented as large circles surrounding the resource area. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California.",
    "The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. The GIS Unit serves all County departments and external customers and provides data on land, features and people of Santa Cruz County. Santa Cruz County encompasses 4 cities and approximately 265,000 people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
    "These data were compiled from many different sources; therefore, the accuracy of the individual layers varies significantly, and some layers do not align exactly with others. In the urban areas, data are generally accurate within five to ten feet of their true geographic coordinates, but in the rural areas, data may be accurate to only within three hundred feet. With these limitations, the County of Santa Cruz disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy or correctness of this data. This disclaimer is exclusive and in lieu of any warranties, fitness for particular purpose, and/or any other type of warranty, whether expressed or implied.",
