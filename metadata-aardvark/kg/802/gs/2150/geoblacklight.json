    "Map of eastern hemisphere surrounded by tabular text giving “country” name, chronology of its rule, coded numbers for location on map and for country of loyalty. Below the map, but within the neat line, are “Les Sept Merveilles du Monde” (Seven Wonders of the World), as seven small circular illustrations. On the inset, superimposed map (8.4 cm. diameter) entitled “AMERIQUE”, California is shown as a large, unlabeled island. Coastline of mainland missing to its north, but suggestion of northwest passage westward from Hudson Bay comes close to California, through the area labelled “N. Bretagne.”"
