    "The University of California, Berkeley Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ) collection of amphibians and reptiles contains over 265,000 catalogued specimens. As of 8 April 2004, 123 of these have been designated holotypes, three are neotypes, three are syntypes, and 1793 are paratypes and paratopotypes. The oldest amphibian specimens date to 1876 and the oldest reptiles to 1861.Museum of Vertebrate Zoology collections database records. Taxonomically, the collection contains representatives of every Amphibian and Reptile Order. Among Amphibians, approximately 87% of families and 53% of genera are represented. Among Reptiles, about 90% of families and 65% of genera are represented. This point shapefile depicts the location at which each species was first identified in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California. This data was used by the Conservation Lands Network Amphibian, Reptile and Invertebrate Team.",
    "This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
