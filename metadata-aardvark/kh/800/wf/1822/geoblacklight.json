    "The data provided here denotes the authors’\nrevised service areas for a subset of 377 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) for\nwhich HUD previously estimated service areas. Using HUD\nadministrative data on the location of Housing Choice Voucher holders, HUD’s\nestimated service areas were revised to better capture voucher activity.\nSpecifically, the authors developed two different tests and correction\nprocedures. The first assesses if the estimated service area omits a sizable\nshare of voucher holder locations (so is “too small”), and if so, adjusts to\ninclude census designated places or counties containing at least 5 percent of a\nPHA’s voucher holders.  The second test\nchecks whether the estimated service boundary includes areas the PHA does not\nappear to serve and that are clearly served by another PHA (so is “too large”),\nin this case adjusting by removing those areas. 148 of the 377 PHA estimated\nservice areas were found to be too small, too large, or both, and so have\nrevised service areas that differ from HUD’s estimated service areas. The\ndetailed methodology is provided below. Additionally, a spreadsheet is supplied\nthat identifies geographies that were added to and dropped from HUD’s estimated\nservices to create the revised service areas for affected PHAs.\n\n\n\nThis is an experimental dataset that is\ndesigned to aid researchers in studying the HCV program. The methodology and\nthe service areas themselves have not been validated by HUD’s Office of Public and Indian\nHousing (PIH) or the Public Housing Agencies. For additional discussion of the\napproach, see Tauber et al. (2024); please\ncontact the authors with any questions or comments.\n\n\n\nReference:Tauber, Kristen, Ingrid Gould Ellen, and Katherine\nO’Regan. 2024. “Whom Do We Serve?
