  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile depicts major playas, salt pans and intermittent lakes worldwide. Care must be taken not to have playas extend beyond flat areas indicated on the raster shaded relief. Generalized from 10m playas. These data are represented at 1:50,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0).",
    "Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software."
