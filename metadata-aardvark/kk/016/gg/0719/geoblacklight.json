    "The map spans the area from Saldanha Bay to False Bay and shows land cultivated by the Dutch East India Company (with Italian versions of the names of many of the early farmers), sweet water wells, salt pans, woods, rivers and sailing ships off the West Coast. The map indicates \"Isola di Robbi\" (Robben Island) and \"Isola de Daini\" (Dassen Island), routes to the homesteads of indigenous peoples and the real or imagined location of \"Elefanti\", \"Tigri\" and \"Rinoceri\".
