    "This polyline shapefile depicts streams in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California study area. Stream data was integral to many aspects of the development of the Conservation Lands Network, in particular for the Fish and Riparian Focus Team. The data was pulled from the portion of the National Hydrography Dataset representing drainage network with features such as rivers, streams, canals, lakes, ponds, coastline, dams and streamgages.",
    "This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
