  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile contains targeted employment areas (TEAs) in San Joaquin County, California. TEAs are regions in the U.S. for which the threshold for investment for an investor to be eligible for the EB-5 visa is $500,000 (as opposed to the usual $1,000,000 threshold for the U.S. as a whole). There are two kinds of TEAs: high unemployment areas (defined as areas having unemployment more than 150% the national average calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) and rural areas (defined as areas outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area). In California, the investor may petition the state government for designating a particular subdivision of the area as an area of high unemployment (over 150% the national average).[9] The California Department of Housing and Community Development provides a list of street ranges and census tracts for TEAs. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for San Joaquin County in California.",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
