  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile contains dental health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) in California. The federal Dental HPSA designation (formerly Health Manpower Shortage Areas) identifies areas as having a shortage of dental providers on the basis of availability of dentists and dental auxiliaries. To qualify for designation as a Dental HPSA, an area must be: 1. A rational service area, [the Federal Shortage Designation Branch recognizes Medical Services Study Areas as rational service areas.] 2. Population to general practice dentist ratio: 5,000:1 or 4,000:1 plus population features demonstrating \"unusually high need.\" 3. A lack of access to dental care in surrounding areas because of distance, overutilization, or access barriers. Benefits of designation as a Dental HPSA include: Student loan repayment and personnel placement through the National Health Service Corps (NHSC); Eligibility for the California State Loan Repayment Program; Scholarships for dental training in return for service in a shortage area; and Funding priorities for training in general practice dentistry in programs that provide substantial training in shortage areas. This is version 7 of the data. (Updated: July 2014). This layer is part of the Healthcare Atlas of California.",
    "This data was developed by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development's (OSHPD) Healthcare Workforce and Community Development Division (HWCDD).  The data is used to support the following programatic areas: to encourage demographically underrepresented groups to pursue healthcare careers, to identify geographic areas of unmet need, and to encourage primary care physicians and non-physician practitioners to provide healthcare in medically underserved areas in California.",
