    "This line shapeile represents roads at 1:24000 scale. This layer was derived from a state level coverage originally created by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Line features from the original source data were selected based on their spatial location within the extent of the Russian River basin.",
    "The intended purpose of this dataset is to provide users with a line feature type data layer at 1:24,000 scale that describes and illustrates the roads contained within the extent of the Russian River basin.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
