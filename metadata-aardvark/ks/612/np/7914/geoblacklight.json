    "This map illustrates satellite-detected, potentially damaged structures in the central western part of the city of Cuernavaca and more specifically in the neighborhoods of Downtown, La Mina 2 and Altavista, Cuernavaca Municipality, Morelos State, Mexico. UNITAR-UNOSAT detected a general moderate damage with a few collapsed structures and identified 1,494 potentially affected structures. The analysis was performed following the 19 September 2017 M7.1 earthquake using a post-event WorldView-3 satellite image acquired on 22 September 2017 and a pre-event WorldView-2 satellite image acquired on 13 February 2017.",
    "This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org to seek clarification.",
