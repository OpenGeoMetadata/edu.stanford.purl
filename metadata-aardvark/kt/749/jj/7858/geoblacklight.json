    "This polygon shapefile shows the areas innundated by the centinnial flood of the Seine River in Paris, France during 1740. This layer distinguishes the flooded areas by direct submersion of the Seine ('roads') and those by the upwelling in the cellars ('caves').",
    "The ALPAGE programme aims to provide collaborative tools for the Humanities and Social Sciences and for Information Communication Technology (ICT) allowing for the development of research about the Parisian urban area. This aim is achieved by means of a GIS that includes cadastral and historical layers.",

Therefore, use of this data by others must respect the legal requirements specific to this licence. All freely downloadable data contains the shapefiles, metadata file and licence files describing the users rights and responsibilities. All data produced within the consortium is published in this way with the exception of any ongoing work which is in process of academic evaluation (masters, doctoral thesis, habilitation to supervise research).",
