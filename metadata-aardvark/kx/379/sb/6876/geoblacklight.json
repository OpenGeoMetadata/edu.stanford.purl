    "This point shapefile represents all operable bulk petroleum product terminals located in the 50 States and the District of Columbia with a total bulk shell storage capacity of 50,000 barrels or more, and/or ability to receive volumes from tanker, barge, or pipeline. Survey locations were adjusted using public data. These data were gathered from \"EIA-815, Monthly Bulk Terminal and Blender Report.\" These data are current as of November 2014. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data produced by the U.S. National Energy Information Administration.",
