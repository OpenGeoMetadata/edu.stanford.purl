    "LABOR MARKET ENGAGEMENT INDEXSummary\n\n\nThe labor market engagement index provides a summary description of the relative intensity of labor market engagement and human capital in a neighborhood. This is based upon the level of employment, labor force participation, and educational attainment in a census tract (i). Formally, the labor market index is a linear combination of three standardized vectors: unemployment rate (u), labor-force participation rate (l), and percent with a bachelor’s degree or higher (b), using the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere means  and standard errors  are estimated over the national distribution. Also, the value for the standardized unemployment rate is multiplied by -1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nValues are percentile ranked nationally and range from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the higher the labor force participation and human capital in a neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\nData Source: American Community Survey, 2006-2012.\nRelated AFFH-T Local Government, PHA and State Tables/Maps: Table 12; Map 9.\n\n\n\n  \nTo learn more about the Labor Market Engagement Index visit: https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/4868/affh-raw-data/Date of Coverage: 02/2018",
