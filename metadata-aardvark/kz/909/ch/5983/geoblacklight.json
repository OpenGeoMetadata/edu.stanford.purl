  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile depicts internal, first-order administrative boundaries and polygons with large lakes for all but a few tiny countries. All countries having 10m admin-1 with scale ranks 1 or less should be present in this file. Currently only the United States are represented. Boundaries should perfectly match the following 110m Natural Earth Vector themes: coastline, lake shoreline, admin-0 country boundary, river and lake centerlines. For more detailed breakdowns for most countries in the world, see 10m admin-1. These data are represented at 1:110,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0).",
    "Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software."
