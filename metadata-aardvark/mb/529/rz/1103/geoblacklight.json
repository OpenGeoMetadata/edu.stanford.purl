    "This layer is a georeferenced image of a map of Shanghai that was published in 1901. It shows historical Shanghai city data such as roads, strucutres, and land cover. The map reads: \"Carte dressée par le Capitaine Gadoffre, avec la collaboration des Lieutenants Muselli et Ringue et du Soldat Bouat. 16e régiment d'Infanterie coloniale.\" \"Carte provisoire faite sans instruments de précision - angles déterminés à la boussole Peigné - distances mesurées au pas étalonné.\"",
    "Virtual Shanghai is a research and resource platform on the history of Shanghai from the mid-nineteenth century to nowadays. It incorporates various sets of documents: essays, original documents, photographs, maps, quantitative data, etc. The objective of the project is to write a history of the city through the combined mobilization of these various types of documents. The implementation of this approach relies on the use of digital and GIS technologies. On the research side, the platform offers various ways to step into the history of the city and follow its course at different levels over time. On the resource side, apart from providing original textual and visual documents, it develops a powerful cartographic tool for spatial analysis and real-time mapping. The authors of the present project subscribe to the idea of sharing scholarship and research tools for the benefit of scholars, students, and citizens at large.",
