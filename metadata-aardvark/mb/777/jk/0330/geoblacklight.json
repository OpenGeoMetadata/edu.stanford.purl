    "This polygon shapefile displays water bodies in the San Francisco Bay area of California. This category includes lakes, ponds, bays, rivers, reservoirs and other water features. Predominant features represented in this layer have Census Feature Class Codes (CFCCs) of: H01 (Shoreline of perennial water feature); H11 (Perennial stream or river); H12 (Intermittent stream, river, or wash); H21 (Perennial canal, ditch, or aqueduct); H31 (Perennial lake or pond); H41 (Perennial reservoir); H51 (Bay, estuary, gulf, or sound). The Feature Name attribute further identifies water bodies as rivers, creeks, branches, forks, etc. MTC derived these data from the Census 2000 California Waterbodies dataset. This layer is part of the Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) GIS Maps and Data collection.",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
