    "This line shapefile represents high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes within the San Francisco Bay Area of California. An HOV lane (also known as carpool lane) is a restricted traffic lane reserved at peak travel times or longer for the exclusive use of vehicles with a driver and one or more passengers, including carpools, vanpools, and transit buses. This layer is part of the Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) GIS Maps and Data collection.",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
