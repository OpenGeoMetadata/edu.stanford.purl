    "This point shapefile represents natural gas processing plants in the United States in 2012 with select updates through 2013. Zip code centroids are used for map location. These data were gathered from the EIA-757, Natural Gas Processing Plant Survey. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data produced by the U.S. National Energy Information Administration.",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
