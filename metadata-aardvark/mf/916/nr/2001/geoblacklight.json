    "This raster dataset depicts a final version of the Coarse Filter Vegetation Map as a 30 meter grid with 61 cover types, 51 of which are natural or semi-natural land cover, for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region and Santa Cruz County, California. See Resource Details for detailed data compilation description. This data was compiled from data sourced from the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, The Nature Conservancy and the California Department of Forestry and Fire.",
    "This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
