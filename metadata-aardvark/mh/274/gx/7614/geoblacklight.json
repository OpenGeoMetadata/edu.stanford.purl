    "This polygon shapefile contains designated areas for particulate matter &lt; 2.5 microns, according to the annual National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) standard of 15 ug/m3. Designated area coverage is EPA Region 9 including Hawaii, California, Nevada, and Arizona.Non-Attainment areas are geographic areas which have not met National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter air pollution. These standards are part of the Clean Air Act. See Code of Federal Regulations, Section 40 Part 81, for detailed information about Ambient Air Quality Standards.",
