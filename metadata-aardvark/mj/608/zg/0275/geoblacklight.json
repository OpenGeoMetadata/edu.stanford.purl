    "This map layer portrays the major roads in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The file was produced by joining the individual State roads layers from the National Highway Planning Network (NHPN), Geographic Data Technology (GDT) Dynamap, and TIGER/Line files. This is a revised version of the July 2012 map layer. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States.",
    "These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.",
