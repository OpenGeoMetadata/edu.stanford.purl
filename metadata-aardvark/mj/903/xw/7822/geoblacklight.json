    "This polygon shapefile represents the boundaries of HUD Homeownership Centers (HOCs).

FHA has four Homeownership Centers that are organized to serve specific states; Atlanta, Philadelphia, Denver and Santa Ana. Data is current as of 11/16/2012.",
    "This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)"
