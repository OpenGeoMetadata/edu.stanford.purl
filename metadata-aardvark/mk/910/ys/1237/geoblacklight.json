    "This polygon shapefile contains the censives (territories ruled by lords) in Paris, France as represented in Philibert Vasserot's Atlas of Paris (1810-1836). From the Middle Ages until the Revolution, land in Paris was divided between many lordships. Lords, or seigneurs, who granted tenure for plots of land (censives) to owners through imposition of a annual fee (cens). Censives granted certain rights to the seigneur, such as rights of land transfer and political authority over roads and courts. The public roads indicated in Vasserot's map have been excluded from the censives.",
    "The ALPAGE programme aims to provide collaborative tools for the Humanities and Social Sciences and for Information Communication Technology (ICT) allowing for the development of research about the Parisian urban area. This aim is achieved by means of a GIS that includes cadastral and historical layers.",
