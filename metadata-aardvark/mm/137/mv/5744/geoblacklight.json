    "This point shapefile contains the latest version of the Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) database of operational and under construction landfill gas (LFG) energy projects; candidate municipal solid waste landfills having LFG energy potential; and information on additional landfills that could represent LFG energy opportunities. The information contained in the LMOP database is compiled from a variety of sources by the EPA, including annual voluntary submissions by LMOP Partners and industry publications. This layer is a part of a collection of GIS data containing renewable and electric energy information for the U.S., including data on transmission lines, power plants and electricity substations.",
    "This shapefile can be used to locating and analyze existing and potential landfills sites in the United States for the purpose of methane recovery.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
