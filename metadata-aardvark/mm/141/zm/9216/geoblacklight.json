    "This line shapefile represents a 1- by 1-degree latitude-longitude grid covering the world with attributes that allow it to display grids at intervals of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 degrees. To display a grid with a 1-degree interval, simply display all of the lines. To display a coarser grid (e.g., a 15-degree interval), in the Layer Properties dialog box, add the DEGREE15 attribute value equal to Y. This layer is part of the 2014 ESRI Data and Maps collection for ArcGIS 10.2.",
