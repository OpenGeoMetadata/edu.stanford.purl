    "This line shapefile contains geologic folds for the offshore area of Coal Oil Point, California. This map area is in the Ventura Basin, in the southern part of the Western Transverse Ranges geologic province, which is north of the California Continental Borderland (Fisher and others, 2009). Significant clockwise rotation--at least 90 degrees--since the Miocene has been proposed for the Western Transverse Ranges province (Luyendyk and others, 1980; Hornafius and others, 1986; Nicholson and others, 1994), and this region is presently undergoing north-south shortening (see, for example, Larson and Webb, 1992). In the eastern part of the map area, cross sections suggest that this shortening is, in part, accommodated by offset on the North Channel, Red Mountain, South Ellwood, and More Creek Fault systems (Bartlett, 1998; Heck, 1998; Redin and others, 2005; Leifer and others, 2010). Crustal deformation in the western part of the Offshore of Coal Oil Point map area apparently is less complex than that in the eastern part (Redin, 2005); the western structure is dominated by a large, south-dipping homocline that extends from the south flank of the Santa Ynez Mountains beneath the continental shelf. A map which shows these data is published in Scientific Investigations Map 3302, \"California State Waters Map Series--Offshore of Coal Oil Point, California.\" This layer is part of USGS Data Series 781.",
    "In 2007, the California Ocean Protection Council initiated the California Seafloor Mapping Program (CSMP) to create a comprehensive seafloor map of high-resolution bathymetry, marine benthic habitats and geology within the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. CSMP has divided coastal California into 110 map blocks, each to be published individually as United States Geological Survey Open-File Reports (OFRs) or Scientific Investigations Maps (SIMs) at a scale of 1:24,000. Maps display seafloor morphology and character, identify potential marine benthic habitats and illustrate both the seafloor geology and shallow (to about 100 m) subsurface geology. Data layers for bathymetry, bathymetric contours, acoustic backscatter, seafloor character, potential benthic habitat and offshore geology were created for each map block, as well as regional-scale data layers for sediment thickness, depth to transition, transgressive contours, isopachs, predicted distributions of benthic macro-invertebrates and visual observations of benthic habitat from video cruises over the entire state. These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy  makers, and the general public. This information is not intended for navigational purposes.The data can be used with geographic information systems (GIS) software to display geologic and oceanographic information. Additionally, this coverage can provide a geologic map for the public and geoscience community to aid in assessments and mitigation of geologic hazards in the coastal region and sufficient geologic information for land-use and land-management decisions both onshore and offshore.",
