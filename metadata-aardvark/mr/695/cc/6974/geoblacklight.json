    "This service provides location, and relevant data for Community Challenge Planning Grant recipients. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Community Challenge Planning Grant Program fosters reform and reduces barriers to achieving affordable, economically vital, and sustainable communities. Such efforts may include amending or replacing local master plans, zoning codes, and building codes, either on a jurisdiction-wide basis or in a specific neighborhood, district, corridor, or sector to promote mixed-use development, affordable housing, the reuse of older buildings and structures for new purposes, and similar activities with the goal of promoting sustainability at the local or neighborhood level.The Sustainable Communities Planning Grant Program is being initiated in close coordination with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), co-leaders with HUD in the Partnership for Sustainable Communities.To learn more about the HUD FHA Revitalization Areas Program visit: https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/economic_development/HUD-DOT_Community_Challenge_Grants/Data Dictionary: DD_Community Challenge Grantees",
