  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon file depicts disrupted ground regions within the Albion River watershed in Mendocino County, California. Disrupted ground consists of debris slide amphitheaters and slopes and inner gorges are not technically landslides, but features formed by landslides processes.",
    "This mapping began as part of the North Coast Watershed Assessment Program (NCWAP) which was de-funded by the Legislature in June 2003, the work was subsequently completed in late 2003 and early 2004. The California Geological Survey (CGS) evaluated the geology, fluvial geomorphic characteristics, relative slope stability and geomorphic characteristics within the watershed, and compiled the digital geospatial data described in this document. This mapping and compilation is geared toward providing baseline geologic and geomorphic data to aid in responsible land management, as well as the development of watershed restoration projects, watershed management strategies, and watershed plans.",
