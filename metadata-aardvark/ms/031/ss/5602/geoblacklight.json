    "This line shapefile contains isohyetal contours showing the average rainfall in inches per year for the Monterey County, California.

This layer is part of a collection describing Geology resources and constraints Monterey County, California.",
    "The purpose of this data set is to aid in evaluating the countywide rainfall amounts, which in turn influence other processes such as aquifer recharge potential.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
