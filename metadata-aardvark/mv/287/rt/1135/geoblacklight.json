    "This dataset contains regions representing the domains of the digital update units from National Hydrography Data and features were selected based on their spatial location within the extent of the Russian River basin and contains reach codes for networked features and isolated lakes, flow direction, names, stream level, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined to represent waterbodies.",
    "This dataset describes the lakes of the Russian River basin and is intended for hydrography analysis and planning.",
