    "This raster dataset contains population counts at 30 arc second resolution (1 km. or finer) for 2016. This release represents the 2016 edition of LandScan and succeeds all previous versions. Using an innovative approach with Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing, ORNL's LandScan is the community standard for global population distribution. At approximately 1 km resolution (30\" X 30\"), LandScan is the finest resolution global population distribution data available and represents an ambient population (average over 24 hours). The LandScan algorithm, an R&amp;D 100 Award Winner, uses spatial data and imagery analysis technologies and a multi-variable dasymetric modeling approach to disaggregate census counts within an administrative boundary. Since no single population distribution model can account for the differences in spatial data availability, quality, scale, and accuracy as well as the differences in cultural settlement practices. This dataset is part of the LandScan 2016 global population database.",
    "Developed for the U. S. Department of Defense. Allows for quick and easy assessment, estimation, and visualization of populations-at-risk.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
