    "This polygon shapefile depicts the boundaries of water districts in the County of Santa Cruz, California: Central, Lompico County, San Lorenzo Valley, Scotts Valley and Soquel Creek. A Water District has an elected Board, qualifies as a Special District and is tasked with supplying water and sewer needs to a community. According to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) (from pg 71 A Guide to LAFCO Procedures - San Diego LAFCO 1995), water districts furnish sufficient water throughout the District for any present or future beneficial use. To accomplish this purpose, the district has the power for storage and conservation of water and water rights and the operation of waterworks. LAFCO was created in 1963 to encourage orderly formation of local government agencies, preserve agricultural land resources and discourage urban sprawl. LAFCO is responsible for coordinating logical and timely changes in local governmental boundaries, conducting special studies that review ways to reorganize, simplify, and streamline governmental structure and preparing a sphere of influence for each city and special district within each County. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California.",
    "The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. The GIS Unit serves all County departments and external customers and provides data on land, features and people of Santa Cruz County. Santa Cruz County encompasses 4 cities and approximately 265,000 people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
    "These data were compiled from many different sources; therefore, the accuracy of the individual layers varies significantly, and some layers do not align exactly with others. In the urban areas, data are generally accurate within five to ten feet of their true geographic coordinates, but in the rural areas, data may be accurate to only within three hundred feet. With these limitations, the County of Santa Cruz disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy or correctness of this data. This disclaimer is exclusive and in lieu of any warranties, fitness for particular purpose, and/or any other type of warranty, whether expressed or implied.",
