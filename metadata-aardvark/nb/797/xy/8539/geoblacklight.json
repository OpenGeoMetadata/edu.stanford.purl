    "This polygon shapefile depicts habitat plan category one stream buffers in the County of Santa Clara, California. According to the California State Water Resources Control Board, a buffer zone is a strip of land, along all sides of a body of water, where additional avoidance measures and management practices are required for protection of the quality and beneficial uses of water, fish and riparian wildlife habitat, other forest resources and for controlling erosion. This layer is maintained by the Santa Clara County Planning Office TeamGIS, for the benefit of the Santa Clara Valley Habitat Agency. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Santa Clara County, California.",
