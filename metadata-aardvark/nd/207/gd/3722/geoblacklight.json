    "This point shapefile contains site locations from the National Register of Historic Places in Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island within 10km of the coastal shoreline. for Maine, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island. The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) was established by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. The NRHP database is a listing of sites (buildings, objects, etc.) and areas (large properties, districts, etc.) which have some sort of cultural or historical significance in American history and are noteworthy for preservation (http://www.nps.gov/nr/about.htm). This dataset is a compilation of NRHP from state databases. Please be advised that some NRHP in this dataset may be missing as the states are currently working on updating their databases and datasets. New Hampshire and Connecticut NRHP are not included in this product since spatial datasets are currently being developed. This regional dataset will be updated as states provide updates to datasets. Users must consult with appropriate State and/or Tribal Preservation Offices in the identification and evaluation of historic properties as stated under the National Preservation Act. This regional dataset compiled by Northeast Ocean Data serves as a baseline for identifying NRHP; users must confirm with appropriate State and/or Tribal Preservation Offices for official listings under the National Register of Historic Places. For more information and current listings of NRHP, please be directed to the National Park Serviceâ€™s Natio",
