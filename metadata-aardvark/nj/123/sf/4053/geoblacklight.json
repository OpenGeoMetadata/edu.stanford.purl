    "Promise Zones are high-poverty urban, rural and tribal communities with whom the federal government will partner and invest to create jobs, leverage private investment, increase economic activity, expand educational opportunities, and reduce violent crime. Through a competitive application process, Promise Zone designees have identified a set of outcomes they will pursue to revitalize their communities, develop a strategy supporting those outcomes, and realign resources accordingly. The first round of designees were announced in January 2014 with new designees announced on an annual basis. Participating agencies: HUD, USDA, Commerce, CNCS, Ed, HHS, DOJ, DOL, SBA, Treasury. Original Release Date: Fiscal year 2016 Last Revision Date: 09/14/2016",
    "This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)"
