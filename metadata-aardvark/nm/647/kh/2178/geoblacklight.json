  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This line shapefile shows lines of equal horizontal intensity of the Earth's magnetic field, derived from the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) for the epoch 2010.0. Magnetic intensity is the strength of the magnetic field, and is described in terms of a horizontal component and a vertical component. Horizontal intensity is the horizontal strength of the magnetic field. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States.",
    "These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.",
