    "This raster data layer was created as part of the Northwest Atlantic Marine Ecoregional Assessment. The Nature Conservancy developed this science-based ecoregional assessment for the Northwest Atlantic Marine region (Bay of Fundy to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina). This assessment synthesizes information on oceanography, chemistry, geology, biology, and social science to inform decisions about coastal and marine ecosystems. By integrating this information at a regional level, the Conservancy is able to provide both a greater understanding of the interrelated biological diversity of the marine ecoregion, and a clearer picture of the current condition of its natural areas and the challenges to their continued persistence. The ten categories of targets identified as the primary structure for the marine ecoregional assessment are: coastal and estuarine habitats, benthic habitats, diadromous fish, demersal fish, pelagic fish, forage fish, nearshore shellfish, shorebirds and seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles. For more information and a detailed report, please visit http://nature.org/namera/. Seabed forms classify seafloor topography into discrete units. Derived from The Nature Conservancy's derived digital bathymetry, seabed forms can be described by a combination of just two variables: seabed position and slope. Seabed position (also referred to as topographic position or slope position) describes the topography of the area surrounding a particular cell. We based our seabed position calculations on Fels and Zobel's (1995) method, which evaluates the elevation differences between the model cell and the surrounding cells within a specified distance.",
