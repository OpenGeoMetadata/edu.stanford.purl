    "North polar projection with California as an island with rounded northern coastline. Surrounded by sky, half lit by sun, and a ring of the zodiac figures with names of the months. All within drawing of 24-hour table clock. Mountain ranges shown in America. Another example observed with bannered title: Nulla dies abeat, quin linea ducta supersit. (above map) and with Johannes Georgio Eberspergerg fecit (below map). Probably cut from a title page of the Atlas series (Title Page Entry 15). Text to clock left and right entitled \"Bericht vom Nutzen und Gebrauch diser Uhr\".",
    "With compressed text in German to clock left and in Dutch to clock right. Title in both German and Dutch: GEOGRAPHISCHE UNIVERSAL - ZEIG UND SCHLAG-UHR : WEERELD-BEELDIGH WYS EN SLAG WERK. No mountain ranges in America shown. No imprint. Text above title mentions Zacharias Landteck."
