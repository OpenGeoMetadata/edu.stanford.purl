    "Created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program (LIHTC) gives State and local LIHTC-allocating agencies the equivalent of nearly $8 billion in annual budget authority to issue tax credits for the acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction of rental housing targeted to lower-income households. Although some data about the program have been made available by various sources, HUD's database is the only complete national source of information on the size, unit mix, and location of individual projects. With the continued support of the national LIHTC database, HUD hopes to enable researchers to learn more about the effects of the tax credit program.HUD has no administrative authority over the LIHTC program. IRS has authority at the federal level and it is structured so that the states truly administer the program. The LIHTC property locations depicted in this map service represent the general location of the property. The locations of individual buildings associated with each property are not depicted here. The location of the property is derived from the address of the building with the most units. Location data for HUD-related properties and facilities are derived from HUD's enterprise geocoding service. While not all addresses are able to be geocoded and mapped to 100% accuracy, we are continuously working to improve address data quality and enhance coverage. Please consider this issue when using any datasets provided by HUD. When using this data, take note of the field titled “LVL2KX” which indicates the overall accuracy of the geocoded address using the following return codes:‘R’ - Interpolated rooftop (high degree of accuracy, symbolized as green)‘4’ - ZIP+4 centroid (high degree of accuracy, symbolized as green)‘B’ - Block group centroid (medium degree of accuracy, symbolized as yellow)‘T’ - Census tract centroid (low degree of accuracy, symbolized as red)‘2’ - ZIP+2 centroid (low degree of accuracy, symbolized as red)‘Z’ - ZIP5 centroid (low degree of accuracy, symbolized as red)‘5’ - ZIP5 centroid (same as above, low degree of accuracy, symbolized as red)Null - Could not be geocoded (does not appear on the map)For the purposes of displaying the location of an address on a map only use addresses and their associated lat/long coordinates where the LVL2KX field is coded ‘R’ or ‘4’. These codes ensure that the address is displayed on the correct street segment and in the correct census block.The remaining LVL2KX codes provide a cascading indication of the most granular level geography for which an address can be confirmed. For example, if an address cannot be accurately interpolated to a rooftop (‘R’), or ZIP+4 centroid (‘4’), then the address will be mapped to the centroid of the next nearest confirmed geography: block group, tract, and so on. When performing any point-in polygon analysis it is important to note that points mapped to the centroids of larger geographies will be less likely to map accurately to the smaller geographies of the same area. For instance, a point coded as ‘5’ in the correct ZIP Code will be less likely to map to the correct block group or census tract for that address. To learn more about the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program visit: https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/ph/Data Dictionary: DD_Low Income Tax Credit Program",
