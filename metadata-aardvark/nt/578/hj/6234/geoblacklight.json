    "This polygon shapefile depicts land use boundaries of the General Plan for unincorporated areas in the County of Sacramento, California effective through 2030, including Agricultural, Residential, Public, Commercial, Industrial, Open Space and Recreational. The General Plan is a set of policies, programs and maps that form a blueprint for physical development in the unincorporated County. The plan addresses important community issues such as new growth, housing needs and environmental protection. It's policies are instrumental in planning infrastructure to accommodate future growth. State law requires that all California Counties and Cities adopt General Plans. On November 9, 2011, the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors adopted an updated General Plan. The planning horizon of the County’s previous General Plan was 1990 to 2010; the updated General Plan’s planning horizon looks out to 2030. Key changes include a new growth management strategy, a stronger focus on addressing existing communities and revitalizing aging commercial corridors, a new Economic Development Element, and strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions consistent with state law. This layer is part of a collection of data originally produced for Sacramento County, California.",
