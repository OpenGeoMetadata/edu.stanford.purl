    "This polygon shapefile depicts converted lands in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California that the Conservation Lands Network (CLN) categorizes as Urban, Cultivated or Rural Residential. Converted Lands played a key role in the removal of fragmented parts of the final CLN, influenced the design of the CLN and are important in understanding the overall urban/suburban/rural landscapes exisitng in the study area.",
    "This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
