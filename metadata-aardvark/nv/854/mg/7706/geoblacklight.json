    "The general plan land use designation layer was generated primarily from the county parcel layer, and most of the land use designation polygons are built from one or many assessor's parcels, although some parcels do have multiple land use designations within their boundaries. For more detail concerning the intended or allowable land uses according to the designations, consult the land use element of the Tuolumne County General Plan. General plan land use designations are accurate at a 1:250,000 scale. July 2023.",
