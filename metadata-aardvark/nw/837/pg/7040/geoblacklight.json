  "dct_description_sm": [
    "The grayscale Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands shaded relief data were derived from National Elevation Dataset (NED) data, and show the terrain of Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands at a resolution of 200 meters. The NED is a raster product assembled by the U.S. Geological Survey, designed to provide national elevation data in a seamless form with a consistent datum, elevation unit, and projection. Data corrections made in the NED assembly process minimize artifacts, permit edge matching, and fill sliver areas of missing data. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition National Atlas of the United States.",
    "The grayscale shaded relief images were developed to portray the terrain of the United States.  They are intended for visual purposes only. The original National Elevation Dataset (NED) data must be used for conducting analysis and determining elevation values.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
