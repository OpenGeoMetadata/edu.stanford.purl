    "This raster dataset contains areas of 30 second cells. The data table (VAT) contains the cell areas in the field: [Area]. The units are square kilometers. The Value Field simply represents a row number for a specific Latitude. All cells on the same row have the same area. Cell areas are largest at the equator and smallest at the poles. This dataset is part of the LandScan 2012 Global Population Database.",
    "The LandScan 2012 Global Population Database was developed for the U. S. Department of Defense. The data allows for quick and easy assessment, estimation, and visualization of populations-at-risk.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
