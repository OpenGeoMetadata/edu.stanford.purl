    "This polygon shapefile represents medical service study areas (MSSA) in California for 2010. MSSAs are the defined geographic analysis unit for the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). MSSAs are a principal component for display of large data bases through OSHPD's and State of California's Geographic Information Systems. MSSAs have the potential for assisting in needs assessment, health planning, and health policy development. MSSA's are reproduced on the decadal census and the boundaries are formally approved by the Health Manpower Policy Commission. Moreover, the US Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources Serviced Administration (HRSA) formally recognizes California MSSA's as the Rational Service Area (RSA) for medical service for California.The 2007 MSSA layer (developed during July 2009 - July 2010) is an update to the 2005 version and represents the boundaries constructed following the census. The MSSA layer is the unique MSSA boundaries composed of aggregated census tracts. This layer is created by dissolving all census tracts on a common MSSA Name/ID. MSSA's are maintained by OSHPD and used by multiple agencies to administer a variety of state and federal health-related programs. This represents the final MSSA Reconfiguration based on U.S. Census 2010, public meetings held throughout California with stakeholder input and approved by the California Healthcare Workforce Policy Commission on May 29, 2013. Revised October, 2013 to add Farallon Island in San Francisco County, CT 9804.01 to MSSA 162d. This layer is part of the Healthcare Atlas of California.",
    "The MSSA ACS layer is an update using 2010 U.S. Census data.   This is an update to geometries and demographics. The Medical Service Study Area (MSSA) Census Tract Detail polygon layer represents all California census tract boundaries used in the construction based on U.S. Census Tracts 2010.  Each of the state's 8,035 census tracts (shoreline buffer census tracts were removed) was assigned to a medical service study area, as identified in this data layer.  The MSSA Census Tract Detail data is aggregated by OSHPD, to create this MSSA data layer.\nThis represents the final MSSA Reconfiguration based on U.S. Census 2010 and public meetings held throughout California.",
