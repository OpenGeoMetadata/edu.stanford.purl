  "dct_description_sm": [
    "Stream inventory data was collected between 1994 and 2002 in tributaries to the Russian River Basin. Data was collected from approximately 180 streams comprising 750 miles (approximately 75% of the remaining steelhead habitat, and 100% percent of the known coho salmon habitat) in the basin. Following completion of a desktop watershed information assessment, the California Department of Fish and Game conducted in-field fish habitat inventories including: 1) stream channel typing; 2) habitat typing; and 3) biological surveys to describe fish habitat utilization and distribution of fish and other aquatic species basin-wide",
    "This dataset was collected to determine if critical habitat needs of a target species are lacking, and if there are areas where improvements can be made by habitat and channel typing, and biological information collected during spawning and juvenile rearing surveys.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
