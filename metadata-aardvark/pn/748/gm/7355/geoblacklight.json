    "Early state map, inaccurate yet elegant. Graphically, it is exceptionally well done. Wheat: \"This was the most elaborate map of California that had yet appeared. It is beautifully designed and drawn, and includes a large number of the mining towns, though it cannot be entirely commended for accuracy.\" A portion of this map was published as Gibbes' New Map of the Gold Region in California, 1851, which was also issued in the Stockton Directory and Emigrant's Guide to the Southern Mines, Stockton, 1852 (Rocq 12978). Full color by county, map is folded into dark green cloth covers 18x10.5 with \"Gibbes' Map Of The State Of California\" stamped in gilt. Sherman and Smith of New York is also listed as Publisher.",
