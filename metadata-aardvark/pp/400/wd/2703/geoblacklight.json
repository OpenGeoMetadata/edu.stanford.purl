    "This point shapefile depicts data for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California from the Passage Assessment Database, which includes locations of existing and potential barriers to salmonid migration in streams with basic information about each record. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife Passage Assessment Database (PAD) is an ongoing inventory of known and potential barriers to anadromous fish, compiling currently available fish passage information from more than 100 data sources and allowing past and future barrier assessments to be standardized and stored in one place. The inventory is to be used to identify barriers suitable for removal or modification to restore spawning and riparian habitat for salmon and steelhead, and to enhance aquatic and riparian habitat. The PAD is intended to be compatible with a variety of other data sets related to anadromous fish issues and all records are saved with geographic location information. This file can be used to represent the known and potential barriers on maps or to provide latitude/longitude coordinates. Each barrier record is indexed to the 24k high-resolution National Hydrography Dataset allowing the user to combine the PAD with other fisheries data tied to the same hydrography. The Fish Screen and Fish Passage Program (FSFPP) conducts inventories of all screened and unscreened diversions and fish passage problems via site visits; it gathers information on the size and number of diversions at each site and presence of existing fish protective facilities. The FSFPP database is fairly comprehesive for the Central Valley streams (Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers systems) and complements PAD that focuses mainly on California's coastal region.",
    "This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
