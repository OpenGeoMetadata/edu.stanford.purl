  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile portrays livestock density in Kenya's rangelands for 1994-96. Most of Kenya’s rangelands contain livestock. Higher livestock numbers can be found in the wetter part of the rangelands and closer to permanent water sources. Livestock densities in large parts of the northeastern rangelands reﬂect pastoral production systems where herders move livestock periodically to follow the seasonal supply of water and feed. In a number of locations in Narok, Kajiado, and Laikipia Districts, high wildlife and livestock densities coincide.",
