    "This polygon shapefile represents the boundary of the Russian River Watershed in California. These data are derived from the California Watershed Map (v.2.2), a set of standardized watershed boundaries meeting standardized delineation criteria.",
    "The purpose of this file is to provide GIS users with a layer of the Russian River Watershed which is not divided into smaller, sub-hydrologic units.  This layer provides users with a layer that can be used to clip datasets that describe geographic regions larger than the area of the watershed.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
