    "These polygon shapefile is a digital version of U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1183, Landslide Overview Map of the Conterminous United States. The map and digital data delineate areas in the conterminous United States where large numbers of landslides have occurred and areas which are susceptible to landsliding. Because the data are highly generalized, owing to the small scale and the scarcity of precise landslide information for much of the country, they are unsuitable for local planning or actual site selection. This National Atlas map layer was previously distributed as Digital Representation of the Landslide Overview Map of the Conterminous United States. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition National Atlas of the United States.",
    "These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:4,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
