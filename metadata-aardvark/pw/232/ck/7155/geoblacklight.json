    "\"G-2-C (Intelligence Section, Topographic Division) was a part of the General Staff and a similar organization was attached to the staff of the 1st and 2nd armies. The 29th Engineers was assigned to G-2 and, in addition to carrying on all the sound and flash ranging, it furnished the commissioned and enlisted personnel for practically all the surveying and mapping operations of the American forces in France. Complete map printing plants were maintained at General Headquarters and the Headquarters of each Army. Mobile printing outfits (photographic and lithographic equipment mounted on large trucks) were attached to each Corps and several of the Divisions.\"--Website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), \"World War I military records of Coast & Geodetic Survey Personnel,\" viewed August 3, 2011."
