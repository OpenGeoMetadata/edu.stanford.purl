    "This line shapefile represents the Continental Divide of the United States. The map layer was created by extracting Hydrologic Unit Boundary line features from an existing National Atlas layer. The source data are aligned with the individual 1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) hypsography files produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition National Atlas of the United States.",
    "These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
