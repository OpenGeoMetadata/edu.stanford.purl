    "This line shapefile represents land and ocean seamlines for the extent of each associated raster dataset in the mosaic dataset. Overlapping raster datasets can be blended along the seamline by a specified width. These data are represented at 1:10,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0).",
    "Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software."
