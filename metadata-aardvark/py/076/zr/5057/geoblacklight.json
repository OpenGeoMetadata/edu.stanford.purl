  "dct_description_sm": [
    "The Local Employment Dynamics (LED) Partnership is a voluntary federal-state enterprise created for the purpose of merging employee, and employer data to provide a set of enhanced labor market statistics known collectively as Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI). The QWI are a set of economic indicators including employment, job creation, earnings, and other measures of employment flows.\nFor the purposes of this dataset, LED data for 2018 is aggregated to Census Summary Level 070 (State + County + County Subdivision + Place/Remainder), and joined with the Housing Opportunities for Person with AIDS (HOPWA) grantee areas spatial dataset for FY2018.\nThe HOPWA program funds are distributed to states and cities by formula allocations and made available as part of the area's Consolidated Plan. Persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families may require housing that provides emergency, transitional, or long-term affordable solutions. In addition, some projects are selected in national competitions to serve as service delivery models or operate in non-formula areas.  Grantees partner with nonprofit organizations and housing agencies to provide housing and support to beneficiaries. \nPlease note that this version of the data does not include Community Planning and Development (CPD) entitlement grantees. LED data for CPD entitlement areas can be obtained from the LED for CDBG Grantee Areas feature service.\n \nTo learn more about the Local Employment Dynamics (LED) Partnership visit: https://lehd.ces.census.gov/\n  \n  \n  Data Dictionary: DD_LED for HOPWA Grantee Areas\n  \n  Date of Coverage: ESG-2021/LED-2018",
