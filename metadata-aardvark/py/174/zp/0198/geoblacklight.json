    "HUD administers Federal aid to local Housing Agencies (HAs) that manage housing for low-income residents at rents they can afford. Likewise, HUD furnishes technical and professional assistance in planning, developing, and managing the buildings that comprise low-income housing developments. This dataset provides the location and resident characteristics of public housing development buildings. Location data for HUD-related properties and facilities are derived from HUD's enterprise geocoding service. While not all addresses are able to be geocoded and mapped to 100% accuracy, we are continuously working to improve address data quality and enhance coverage. Please consider this issue when using any datasets provided by HUD.  When using this data, take note of the field titled “LVL2KX” which indicates the overall accuracy of the geocoded address using the following return codes: ‘R’ - Interpolated rooftop (high degree of accuracy, symbolized as green)  ‘4’ - ZIP+4 centroid (high degree of accuracy, symbolized as green) ‘B’ - Block group centroid (medium degree of accuracy, symbolized as yellow)  ‘T’ - Census tract centroid (low degree of accuracy, symbolized as red)  ‘2’ - ZIP+2 centroid (low degree of accuracy, symbolized as red)  ‘Z’ - ZIP5 centroid (low degree of accuracy, symbolized as red) ‘5’ - ZIP5 centroid (same as above, low degree of accuracy, symbolized as red)  Null - Could not be geocoded (does not appear on the map)  For the purposes of displaying the location of an address on a map only use addresses and their associated lat/long coordinates where the LVL2KX field is coded ‘R’ or ‘4’. These codes ensure that the address is displayed on the correct street segment and in the correct census block. The remaining LVL2KX codes provide a cascading indication of the most granular level geography for which an address can be confirmed. For example, if an address cannot be accurately interpolated to a rooftop (‘R’), or ZIP+4 centroid (‘4’), then the address will be mapped to the centroid of the next nearest confirmed geography: block group, tract, and so on. When performing any point-in polygon analysis it is important to note that points mapped to the centroids of larger geographies will be less likely to map accurately to the smaller geographies of the same area. For instance, a point coded as ‘5’ in the correct ZIP Code will be less likely to map to the correct block group or census tract for that address. In an effort to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the characteristics for each building are suppressed with a -4 value when the “Number_Reported” is equal to, or less than 10.  To learn more about Public Housing visit: https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/ph/ Development FAQs - IMS/PIC | HUD.gov / U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)Data Dictionary: DD_Public Housing Buildings Date Updated: 12/2024",
