  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile depicts the seismic shaking level (peak ground acceleration) with a 10% probability of being exceeded in 50 years for Monterey County, California. Probabilistic seismic shaking maps are prepared using consensus information on historical earthquakes, faults, and geologic materials. A probabilistic seismic hazard map is a map that shows the hazard from earthquakes that geologists and seismologists agree could occur in California. It is probabilistic in the sense that the analysis takes into consideration the uncertainties in the size and location of earthquakes and the resulting ground motions that can affect a particular site. Historic earthquakes, areas damaged, the slip rates of major faults, and geologic materials were combined to calculate the shaking hazard for the peak ground acceleration. The shaking hazard maps show the level of ground motion that has 1 chance in 475 of being exceeded each year, which is equal to a 10% probability of being exceeded in 50 years. These levels of ground shaking are used primarily for formulating building codes and for designing buildings. Information used in preparing the data set was developed in cooperation with the U. S. Geological Survey. This layer is part of a collection describing Geology resources and constraints Monterey County, California.",
    "This purpose of this data set is to provide a regional perspective of earthquake ground shaking hazards in Monterey County. It is no tintended for site-specific hazard analysis,",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
