    "This raster dataset represents density of tanker vessel traffic in 2011 from vessels with Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders in 100 meter grid cells. The dataset is best interpreted using a high to low density scale and does not represent actual vessel counts. in the Northeastern United States. AISs are a navigation safety device that transmits and monitors the location and characteristics of many vessels in U.S. and international waters in real-time.",
