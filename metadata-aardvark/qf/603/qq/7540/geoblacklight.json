    "Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 provides for a loan guarantee component of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program. The Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (Section 108) provides communities with a source of financing for economic development, housing rehabilitation, public facilities, and other physical development projects, including improvements to increase their resilience against natural disasters. The funds can be used by a designated public entity to undertake eligible projects, or, alternatively, can be loaned to a third party developer to undertake the projects. This flexibility makes it one of the most potent and important public investment tools that HUD offers to local governments.
