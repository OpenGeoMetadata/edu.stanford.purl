  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile depicts a mask of the boundary for the County of Solano, California. A mask covers or hides features to enhance cartographic representation by identifying the analysis extent that will be considered when performing an operation or function. Setting an analysis mask means that processing will only occur within the boundaries of Solano County. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data produced by Solano County, California.",
    "Solano Regional Geographic Information Systems Consortium (Solano ReGIS) is a cooperative of local government agencies within Solano County, California, working together to share spatial data, pool resources, and provide GIS expertise to Solano ReGIS members, which include the Cities of Benicia, Dixon, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun City, Vacaville and Vallejo; the County of Solano; the Fairfield-Suisun Sewer District; the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO); the Solano County Water Agency; the Solano Irrigation District; the Solano Transportation Authority; and the Vallejo Sanitation and Flood Control District. These Solano ReGIS members provide public access to applications, maps and spatial data. Solano County encompasses 7 cities and approximately 425,000 people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
