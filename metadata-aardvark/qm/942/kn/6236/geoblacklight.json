    "Map of Russia from Ewing's New General Atlas, which was intended to reflect the settling of European boundaries by the Treaty of Paris and the Congress of Vienna. Shows the full range of European Russia, from Archangel and the \"Northern Ocean\" to the \"Russian Asia\" which encompasses the Ural Mountains and the Caucasus, the city of Astrakhan, the northern tip of the Caspian Sea, and the northern Ural ridge line. Also shows the 1812 acquisition by the Russian Empire of Basarabia or Moldavia, though still showing \"Turkey\" in possession of modern-day Romania, up to the Prut River. \"Lithuania\" extends to the Dnieper, which as of this publication would have been outdated.",
