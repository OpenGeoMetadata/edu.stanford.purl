    "This point shapefile includes Global Map data showing Amtrak intercity railroad terminals in the United States. The data are a modified version of the National Atlas of the United States data set of railroad and bus passenger stations of the United States; those source data are a subset of data available from the Research and Innovative Technology Administration, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (RITA/BTS). There are no Amtrak stations in Alaska or Hawaii.",
    "Global Map data are part of a cooperative effort among national mapping organizations around the world to produce and maintain a standard set of basic cartographic data that supports global investigations of natural and human-built environments. Participating nations prepare data using a common data structure and description to ensure compatibility and to tangibly promote the tenets of the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data."
