    "This service denotes the locations of colonias communities as defined in Section 916 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990.In order to better serve colonia residents, the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (as amended) included Section 916 which called for the border states of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas to set aside a percentage of their annual State CDBG allocations for use in the colonias. The use of these set aside funds is to help meet the needs of the colonias residents in relationship to the need for potable water, adequate sewer systems, or decent, safe and sanitary housing. Therefore, the set-aside funds may be utilized for any CDBG eligible activity that is, or is in conjunction with, a potable water, sewer or housing activity.Per Section 916 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, a \"colonia\" refers to any community that meets the following criteria:(A) is in the State of Arizona, California, New Mexico, or Texas;(B) is in the area of the United States within 150 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico, except that the term does not  include any standard metropolitan statistical area that has a population exceeding 1,000,000;(C) is designated by the State or county in which it is located as a colonia;(D) is determined to be a colonia on the basis of objective criteria, including lack of potable  water supply, lack of adequate sewage systems,  and lack of decent, safe, and sanitary housing, and;(E) was in existence and generally recognized as a colonia before the date of the enactment of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act.To learn more about the State Community Development Block Grant Colonias Set-Aside visit: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg-colonias/.Date of Coverage: 2019",
