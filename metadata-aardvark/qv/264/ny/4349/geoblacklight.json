  "dct_description_sm": [
    "Pending or issued preliminary permits* or issued licenses for offshore hydrokinetic projects that produce energy from the flow of water in ocean currents or tides. The status of these projects is administered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This dataset excludes any sites considered inland. Listings found for maximum capacity and average annual production are estimates obtained from applications submitted to FERC by the licensee. Actual numbers upon build-out could vary. *Preliminary permits maintain priority of application for a license for up to three years while a potential license applicant explores project feasibility and prepares a license application, but do not authorize construction, operation, or maintenance of a hydropower project. While studies are often carried out while potential applicants hold preliminary permits, the permits do not authorize any activity or site access. Such permissions must be obtained from the appropriate authority. In some cases, potential license applicants can obtain a successive permit if they have pursued the preparation of a license application in good faith and with due diligence. Only a small portion of preliminary permits lead to licenses.",
