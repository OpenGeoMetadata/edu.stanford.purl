    "This raster dataset shows the intensity of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the surface of Earth from August 1996 to July 2004 as part of the GSFC TOMS EP/TOMS satellite program at NASA. See the Lineage section for complete information about data sources and porcesses used to create this layer. This dataset is part of the Global Map of Human Impacts to Marine Ecosystems, a collection of data and analyses related to anthropogenic drivers of change in marine ecosystems.",
    "The goal of this research is to estimate and visualize the global impact that humans are having on the oceans' ecosystems. Our analysis, published in Science February 15, 2008, shows that over 40% of the world's oceans are heavily affected by human activities and few if any areas remain untouched.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
