    "This line shapefile represents Hewatt's Transect, located in the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge, Pacific Grove, California. In 1931, a graduate student at Hopkins Marine Station (HMS), Willis Hewatt, took an inventory of invertebrates living along a strip of intertidal rocks 108 yards long and a yard wide. This transect represents the original survey area. These data were provided by Carolyn Sotka, HMS. A transect is line across a habitat or part of a habitat. It can be as simple as a string or rope placed in a line on the ground. The number of organisms of each species can be observed and recorded at regular intervals along the transect.",
    "These data are intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
