    "Sanson's map of Russia, Poland, and Ukraine, extending from the Gulf of Finland to Petite Tartary and to Bulgaria and Tartaria. Laid paper with antique hand coloring, decorative title cartouche lower left. Division into \"guvernii\" (Russian regions) by color. Shows \"Grand Tartarie\" at the far east, \"Septentrional et Glacial\" seas to the north, the reach of Poland and Lithuania to the west, Sweden and \"Laponie\" to the north-west, and \"Petite Tartarie\" to the south,into present-day southern Ukraine and the northern tip of the Crimean Peninsula. As of this map's making there is no Saint Petersburg (founded 1703), but it does show Astrakhan (1558), which was an important shipbuilding river port and launching site for trade with (or attacks on) Persia across the Caspian. Moscow is shown as an important city, but is, for example, shown as smaller than Vilna.",
