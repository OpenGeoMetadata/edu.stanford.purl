  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile depicts major discharges into Southern California's near-coastal marine waters, but does not include discharges into enclosed bays and estuaries. The category 'Major' used to describe this feature was derived from the Marine Life Protection Act South Coast Study Region (SCSR) Scientific Advisory Team (SAT) conclusion. Some facilities were excluded and kept their minor ratings, including small marine labs, aquaculture facilities and a desalination plant in the region.",
    "This coverage displays areas of and information about major ocean wastewater discharges along the Southern California Bight, the curved coastline of Southern California between Point Conception and San Diego.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
