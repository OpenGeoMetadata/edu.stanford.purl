    "The polygon shapefile represents the 2006 California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) Survey flown between August and October of 2006. The photographs were taken from 10,500 feet, utilizing the CDFW's two Partenavia aircraft. Surveys were planned to coincide with periods of minimal change between high and low tides to avoid strong tidal induced currents. The data from Los Angeles Harbor to LaJolla was provided by the Region Nine Kelp Consortium. These data were collected on December 5, 2006. This coverage is complete, although the user should note ommissions. The data area projected in Teale Albers North American Datum 1983.",
    "These data are used to assess the extent of kelp canopy resources along the coast of California.",
    "These are public data. The Department of Fish and Wildlife must be credited with the collection, analysis and distribution of these data.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
