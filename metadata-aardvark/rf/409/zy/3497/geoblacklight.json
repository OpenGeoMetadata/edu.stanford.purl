    "This polyline shapefile depicts most major and minor roads in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California. These data were created from a variety of sources developed over the years, including data from ESRI, the California Department of Transportation, the United States Census Bureau Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER/Line) and counties. It is not meant to be precisely accurate and is primarily used for cartography purposes.",
    "This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
