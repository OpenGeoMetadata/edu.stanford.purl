  "dct_description_sm": [
    "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Real Estate Owned (REO) properties are a result of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) paying a claim to a lending institution on a foreclosed property which was financed with an FHA Insured Mortgage and the lender transferring ownership of the property to HUD. Typically, title to the property is not transferred (or the claim paid) until the previous owner is evicted from the property. Normally, after the home is transferred to HUD, the property will go up for auction on the HUD Home store website. This layer contains single-family residential properties that are up for sale. Data Current As Of: 9/1/2014",
    "This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)"
