    "Introduced in 1993, the  Empowerment Zone (EZ), Enterprise Community (EC), and Renewal Community (RC)  Initiatives sought to reduce unemployment and generate economic growth through  the designation of Federal tax incentives and award of grants to distressed communities.\n  Local, Tribal, and State  governments interested in participating in this program were required to  present comprehensive plans that included the following principles: Strategic  Visions for Change, Community-Based Partnerships, Economic Opportunities, and  Sustainable Community Development. Communities selected to participate in this  program embraced these principles and led projects that promoted economic  development in their distressed communities.\n  The EZ/EC initiative was  implemented in the form of three competitions authorized by Congress in 1994  (round I), 1998 (round II), and 2001 (round III). The EC designation expired in  2004 and EZ and RC designations generally expired at the end of 2009. However,  the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of  2010, Pub. L. No. 111-312 extended the Empowerment Zone and DC Enterprise Zone  designations to December 31, 2011.\n  Following the end of the  first EZ designation extension on December 31, 2011, the American Taxpayer Relief  Act (ATRA) of 2012, signed into law by President Obama on January 2, 2013,  provided for an extension of the Empowerment Zone designations for Empowerment  Zone Tax Credit purposes only until December 31, 2013. The ATRA of 2012 did not  extend the designation of the DC Enterprise Zone.\n  The third retroactive  extension of the Empowerment Zone designation, for the purpose claiming EZ tax  credits only, was the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (TIPA 2014). TIPA  2014 was signed into law by President Obama on December 19, 2014 and extended  the EZ designation for the purpose of businesses and entities claiming EZ tax  incentives until December 31, 2014. TIPA 2014 did not extend the designation of  the DC Enterprise Zone.\nTo learn more about Empowerment Zones  Renewal and Enterprise Communities (EZRC) visit: https://www.hud.gov/hudprograms/empowerment_zones\n  \n  \n  Data Dictionary: DD_Empowerment Zones  Renewal and Enterprise Communities\n  \n  Date of Coverage: Through 2014",
