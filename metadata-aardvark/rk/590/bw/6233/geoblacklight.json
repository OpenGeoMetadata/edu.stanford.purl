  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile depicts land ownership and management within the Russian River basin in California: distinguishing local, state, and federal jurisdictions from private lands and delineating areas managed for the long-term maintenance of natural ecological processes and biodiversity. This layer therefore contains attributes both for ownership and for the level of biodiversity protection.",
    "Land management provides information on the protection status of lands for gap analysis. Following the identification of underprotected elements of biodiversity, land ownership data can help identify lands already in the public sector where a change in management could increase the amount of protection.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
