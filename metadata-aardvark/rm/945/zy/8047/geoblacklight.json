  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This GeoTIFF is a sidescan sonar image of 'Chimney Field' area on the San Gregorio fault zone. The San Gregorio Fault is an active earthquake fault located off the coast of Northern California. The Chimney field area is located on the upper northern flank of Sur Ridge. These data are available in GCS WGS 84 and UTM Zone 10 (NAD 83) projections. This layer is part of the GIS Data of the Monterey Bay collection, a compilation of data and imagery of the Monterey Bay area, including coastline, imagery, and bathymetry.",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. This collection of data provides documented layers of of the Monterey Bay to persons/institutions of interest throughout the research and educational communities."
