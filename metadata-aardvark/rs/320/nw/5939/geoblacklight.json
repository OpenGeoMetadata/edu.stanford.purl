    "Collector's note: Attractive example of the earliest acquirable map of Europe based on modern geographic knowledge, and the earliest acquirable derivative of Waldseemuller's only modern map of Europe, which now exists in a single copy. Though curious to the modern eye, the map's southern orientation was neither an error nor a regression, but an indication of its modernity. Maps based on Ptolemaic sources generally retained Ptolemy's convention of being oriented to the north. However, regional maps printed in Germany in the first part of the 16th century for the use of travelers were oriented to the south in order to be used in conjunction with a solar compass. Since these represented Munster's most accurate and up-to-date sources, his maps derived from them virtually all shared the same, southern, orientation. Most important among Munster's sources was Martin Waldseemuller's 1511 Carta itincrana europae, a four-sheet wall map of Europe, which in turn was heavily influenced by the 1500 and 1501 traveler's maps of Erhard Etzlaub. While Waldseemuller's grand work includes considerably more detail than Munster's much smaller map, its influence both in terms of scope and orientation is unmistakable. The 1511 Carta itineraria europae has survived in a single copy of its 1520 edition; the only other derivative of the map is Munster's extremely rare 1536 Tabula Europa, which was the precursor to his Modernn Europae Descriptio."
