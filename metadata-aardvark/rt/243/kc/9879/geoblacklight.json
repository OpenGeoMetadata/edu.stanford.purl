    "This polygon shapefile depicts boundaries for State (SRA) and Local (LRA) Responsibility Areas for fire protection. Includes hazard classification and hazard codes: 1) Moderate, 2) High and 3) Very High. Enacted in 2011, the state fire prevention fee is applied to parcels with habitable structures within California's State Responsibility Areas (SRA). Residents in SRA neighborhoods receive a bill annually from the state Board of Equalization. SRA, by definition, does not include any lands within city or town limits. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) has a legal responsibility to provide fire protection on all State Responsibility Area (SRA) lands, which are defined based on land ownership, population density and land use SRA designations undergo a thorough 5 year review cycle. The County of San Mateo, California holds authority over the LRA, which includes incorporated cities and cultivated agriculture lands. LRA fire protection is typically provided by city fire departments, fire protection districts, counties nd by CAL FIRE under contract to local government.
