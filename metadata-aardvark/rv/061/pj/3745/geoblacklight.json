    "This polygon shapefile represents built up areas (areas containing a concentration of buildings and other structures) in Albania. The Global Map Albania version 2 was developed based on Global Map Specifications version 2.2. The source data of vector layers were a Digital Map 1:25000 and Orthophoto, map image made in 1985 and orthophoto made in 2008. The data source of Elevation layer was developed using orthophoto 2000 year. The data source of Land Use and Vegetation layer were developed using orthophoto 2012 year. IRS, SPOT and RapidEye satellite images, dual coverage, orthophotos (2012), topographic maps for making Land Cover.",
