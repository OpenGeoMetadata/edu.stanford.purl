    "This raster dataset represents the average gap (in tons per hectare) between observed yields in the year 2000 and a climate-defined potential yield compared to other farmers growing potato crops in areas of similar climate. Spatial resolution: Five minute by five minute resolution (~10 km x 10 km at equator). Temporal resolution: Year 2000 - based of average of census data between 1997-2003.",
    "EarthStat.org serves geographic data sets with the purpose of solving the grand challenge of feeding a growing global population while reducing agricultureâ€™s impact on the environment. The data sets on EarthStat allow users to map the distribution of crops globally, analyze the impact of climate change on crop yields, understand the impacts of fertilizer and manure use and much more."
