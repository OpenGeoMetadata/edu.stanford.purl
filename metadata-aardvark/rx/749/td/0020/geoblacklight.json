    "by M.F. Maury, L.L.D. Lieut. U.S. Navy, Superint'dt. of U.S.N. Observatory ; compiled from materials in the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography, Commodore Charles Morris, Chief of Bureau.",
    "Shows temperature of the water at the surface by month.",
    "Does not cover the southeastern Atlantic south of latitude 40‚Å∞ S.",
    "Sheets individually numbered, e.g.: Series D. No. 1, South Atlantic No. 2. Series D.",
    "Originally intended to be complete in 6 sheets. Sheets 5 and 6, covering the southeastern Atlantic, were not issued.",
    "\"Series D.\"",
    "Thermal charts were released as series D a part of Maury's \"Wind and current charts\", series A-F. 12 sheets were published, 8 for the North Atlantic and 4 for the South Atlantic. Charts for the Pacific were initiated, but never printed. Maury's intent was to furnish mariners with data relating to currents and the circulation of the oceans, and to furnish scientists with locations of cold and warm currents and climatic anomalies. For complete discussion, see \"The wind and current chart series produced by Matthew Fontaine Maury,\" by Marc I. Pinsel, in Navigation : Journal of the Institute of Navigation, v. 28, no. 2 (Summer, 1981), p. 123-137.",
    "Each sheet numbered in upper left margin, e.g.: 72, 73, 74, 75."
