    "This polygon shapefile contains the neighbourhood (quartier) boundaries as depicted in Philibert Vasserot's 19th century atlas of Paris. Prior to 1860, there were 4 quartiers, or neighbourhoods, for each of Paris' 12 arrondissements. These delineations were established by the revolutionary government in 1790 and were reordered in 1860.",
    "The ALPAGE programme aims to provide collaborative tools for the Humanities and Social Sciences and for Information Communication Technology (ICT) allowing for the development of research about the Parisian urban area. This aim is achieved by means of a GIS that includes cadastral and historical layers.",
