    "This polyline shapefile depicts river features of Afghanistan from 1990 until 2004. These data were created by the United States Defense Mapping Agency (USDMA; 1967-1988) 1:100,000 scale topo maps. This layer includes three types of classes primary, secondary and seasonal. However, there are some miss classifications of the rivers and there are no names of the rivers, either.",
    "This layer can be used to view line river features at a 1:100,000 scale. Data at this scale is suitable for general studies and local planning. "
