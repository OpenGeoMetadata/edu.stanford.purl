  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This raster layer represents relative landslide potentials within the Albion River watershed in Mendocino County, California. These data were generated using a landslide potential matrix prepared by geologists familiar with the study area. The matrix is based on landslide feature type and activity, geomorphic features, geology, and slope found within the watershed. The matrix is included in the data dictionary with the relative landslide potential layer information.",
    "This mapping began as part of the North Coast Watershed Assessment Program (NCWAP) which was de-funded by the Legislature in June 2003, the work was subsequently completed in late 2003 and early 2004. The California Geological Survey (CGS) evaluated the geology, fluvial geomorphic characteristics, relative slope stability and geomorphic characteristics within the watershed, and compiled the digital geospatial data described in this document. This mapping and compilation is geared toward providing baseline geologic and geomorphic data to aid in responsible land management, as well as the development of watershed restoration projects, watershed management strategies, and watershed plans.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
