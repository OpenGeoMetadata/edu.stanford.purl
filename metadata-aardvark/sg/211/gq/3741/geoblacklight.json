  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile shows the standard 3 nautical mile California state water boundary. It was created by buffering the line file called county-coast.shp, a generalized CA state boundary. This polygon does not account for the addition area of state water created as a result of offshore rocks or mounts, see especially in the northern part of California. This file has been found to not appropriatly represent the 3 nautical mile boundary as rendered on NOAA nautical charts. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Department of Fish and Game.",
    "This layer can be used to show a 3 mile buffer of the California Coast.",
    "Not for navigation.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
