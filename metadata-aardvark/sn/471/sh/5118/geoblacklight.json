    "This point shapefile represents all operating petroleum refineries located in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other U.S. Territories as of January 1, 2014. These data originate from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Refinery Capacity Report, (EIA-820) Table 3, Capacity of Operable Petroleum Refineries by State. In addition to the sources listed, accuracy for the locations of facilities shown on the map was improved through the use of publicly available sites such as company websites and satellite images from public websites. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data produced by the U.S. National Energy Information Administration.",
