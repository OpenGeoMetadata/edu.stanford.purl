    "This map illustrates damaged structures detected with different media support (newspapers, government reports, web news) and Digital Globe images captured on September 20 (from the web site https://www.digitalglobe.com/opendata/mexico-city-earthquake/post-event) in San Andres Cholula and San Pedro Cholula located in Puebla State, Mexico. The analyzed area is located at 60 km of the epicentral zone of the 19 September 2017 M7.1 earthquake. IGG-UNAM identified 39 damaged structures.",
    "This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org to seek clarification.",
