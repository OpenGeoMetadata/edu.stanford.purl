    "Revitalization areas are United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) designated neighborhoods in need of economic and community development and where there is already a strong commitment by the local governments. Revitalization Areas are the basis for HUD programs such as Good Neighbor Next Door (GNND) and Asset Control Areas (ACA). Data is current as of 06/22/2015.",
    "This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)"
