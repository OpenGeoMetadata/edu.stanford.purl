    "Map is trapezoidal shape. - Title above.",
    "This ptolemaic map comes from the first so called \"Modern Atlas\" by the most famous of all early sixteenth century cosmographers Martin Waldseemüller, since it is the first Ptolemy edition with twenty new regional maps beside the traditional twenty-severn Ptolemaic maps derived from the 1482 Ulm Edition. The Atlas is titled GEOGRAPHIE OPUS NOVISSIMA TRADUCTIONE E GRECORUM ARCHETYPIS published by Johannes Schott in Strassburg 1513 and is one of the most important editions of Ptolemy Atlases. In 1520 a second edition of the atlas was printed by Schott from the same woodcut blocks. Is was reissued in 1522 and 1525 by Laurent Fries adn Johannes Grunninger with size reduced maps."
