    "This line shapefile represents changes in groundwater levels in California. These data represent groundwater changes between spring 2010 and spring 2015. The contours approximate change in the groundwater levels for the unconfined to uppermost semi-confined aquifers and is based on a subset of all of the measurement points, which were selected based on measurement data and well construction information (where available).",
