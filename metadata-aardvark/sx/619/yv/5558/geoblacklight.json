    "[1721?], with changed imprint: Per Caroli Allard ex Officina I. Cóvens et C. Mortier Cum Privilegio. Possibly a separate issue as it is not noted in the known Covens and Mortier atlases. (Covens and Mortier were registered as a business in 1721.)",
    "California as an island on second Sanson model, with indented northern coast. Immediately north is large land mass, Terra Esonis, stretching between America Septentrionalis and Iaponiz' Ins. (Japan) and Yedso. Engraved by: Ph. Tideman del [;] G.v. Gouwen sculp. (bottom left). Title cartouche same as on G.& L. Valck's map of 1710 with crown of feathers, \"America\" (female native) surrounded by native flora and fauna, receiving a subject (lower left). But this map has added inset (bottom left) of part of Zeelandia Nova.",
