    "This raster dataset is a 5-meter resolution slope grid containing multibeam bathymetry data for the Soquel Canyon region of Monterey Bay, California. The surveys for Soquel East &amp; West were conducted on June 15-16, 25, 2008. Marine habitat mapping data for the South Monterey Bay region (Asilomar, Soquel, Portuguese Ledge, Central Monterey Bay) in support of the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative.

    "Marine data offered here represent the efforts of a comprehensive state waters mapping program for California launched by the California State Coastal Conservancy, Ocean Protection Council, Department of Fish and Game, and the NOAA National Marine Sanctuary Program. The ultimate goal is the creation of a high-resolution 1:24,000 scale geologic and habitat base map series covering all of California's 14,500 km2 state waters out to the 3 mile limit, and support of the state's Marine Life Protection Act Initiative (MLPA) goal to create a statewide network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This statewide project requires, involves and leverages expertise from industry, resource management agencies and academia. The tiered mapping campaign involves the use of state-of-the-art sonar, LIDAR (aerial laser) and video seafloor mapping technologies; computer aided classification and visualization; expert geologic and habitat interpretations codified into strip maps spanning California's land/sea boundary; and the creation of an online, publicly accessible data repository for the dissemination of all mapping products.",
