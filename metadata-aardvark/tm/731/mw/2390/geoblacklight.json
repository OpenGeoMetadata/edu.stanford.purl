    "The University of Maine (UMaine) deployed a temporary test turbine in Castine Harbor, ME approximately 0.25 km from shore in the spring of 2013. This is the first grid connected offshore wind turbine in North America. The datasetâ€™s coordinate location was identified from a U.S. Department of Energy proposal report and represents the approximate location of the turbine.",
