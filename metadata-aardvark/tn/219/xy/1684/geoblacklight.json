    "This point shapefile contains the locations of the National Water Information System (NWIS) stations in the Northeastern United States. As part of the Survey's program of disseminating water data to the public, the Water Resources Division (WRD) maintains a distributed network of computers and fileservers for the storage and retrieval of water data collected through its activities at approximately 1.4 million sites.The NWIS is a distributed water database in which data can be processed over a network of workstations and fileservers at Survey offices throughout the United States. The system is composed of four subsystems: the Ground-Water Site-Inventory System, the Water-Quality System, the Automated Data-Processing System, and the Water-Use Data System. Many types of data are stored in the NWIS' distributed, local data bases, including: site information, time-series (flow, stage, precipitation, chemical), peak flow, ground water, water quality, and water use.",
    "To support coastal planning and other activities pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act, Energy Policy Act, Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Rivers and Harbors Act and the Submerged Lands Act.",
