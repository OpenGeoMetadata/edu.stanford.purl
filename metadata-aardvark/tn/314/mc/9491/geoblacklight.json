    "This polygon shapefile represents the Department Boundary for the Aube department of France for 2010. These are the level 2 administrative divisions (ADM2) of Aube. Department is one of the three levels of government below the national level (\"territorial collectivities\"), between the region and the commune. There are 96 departments in metropolitan France and 5 overseas departments, which also are classified as regions. Departments are further subdivided into 342 arrondissements, themselves divided into cantons; the latter two have no autonomy and are used for the organisation of public services and sometimes elections.",
