    "This raster layer is a georeferenced image of a map titled \"Composite Map: (Facsimile) Rocque's Map of London. 1746.\" Published in 1919, this composite map is considered one of the best facsimiles of the original Rocque Map (\"A plan of the cities of London and Westminster, and borough of Southwark\"), created by John Rocque and first published in 1746. A scanned version of this map available from The David Rumsey Map Collection was georeferenced by the Kindred London mapping project. ",
    "The broad goal of the Kindred London project is to create four digitized road networks from four historic maps of London that will be used for an online, interactive web platform that will allow users to experience what it would have been like to travel the streets of London.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
