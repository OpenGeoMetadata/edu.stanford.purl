    "This polygon shapefile represents a land use survey of San Mateo County conducted by the California Department of Water Resources, North Central Regional Office staff. The field work for this survey was conducted during June 2012 by staff visiting each field and noting what was grown. Land use field boundaries were digitized using ArcGIS 10.0 with 2010 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) one-meter imagery as the base. Field boundaries were reviewed and updated using 2012 NAIP imagery when it became available. Field boundaries were not drawn to represent legal parcel (ownership) boundaries, or meant to be used as parcel boundaries. Images and land use boundaries were loaded onto laptop computers that were used as the field data collection tools. GPS units connected to the laptops were used to confirm surveyor's location with respect to the fields. Staff took these laptops into the field and virtually all the areas were visited to positively identify the land use. Land use codes were digitized in the field on laptop computers using ESRI ArcMAP software, version 10.0. This layer is part of the San Mateo County Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment Project.",
