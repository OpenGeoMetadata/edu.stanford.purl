  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This point shapefile represents changes in groundwater levels in California. These data represent groundwater changes between spring 2013 and spring 2016. Each point shows the calculated difference between the measured groundwater levels from the time period. The change in groundwater level is plotted on the map only if a measurement exists in both time periods as well. The colored points in the measurements layer show the location of all wells where the groundwater level change is determined.",
    "This layer is intended to be used as a compliment to data, reports, and other information provided by the California Groundwater Information Center.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
