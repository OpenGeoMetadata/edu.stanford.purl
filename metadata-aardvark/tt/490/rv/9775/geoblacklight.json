  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile shows the approximate locations and watch circles of M1 and M2 moorings in the Monterey Bay region of California. Packet radio transmissions from moorings were used to get the average location of the two moorings over one week then a 1 km watch circle was created around those locations. Shapefiles for this layer are available in WGS84 and UTM Zone 10 (NAD83) projections. This layer is part of the GIS Data of the Monterey Bay collection, a compilation of data and imagery of the Monterey Bay area, including coastline, imagery, and bathymetry.",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. This collection of data provides documented layers of of the Monterey Bay to persons/institutions of interest throughout the research and educational communities."
