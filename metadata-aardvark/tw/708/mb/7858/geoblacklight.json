    "This polygon shapefile represents households with unsatisified basic needs water supply according to the 2011 Census of Uruguay. A particular household will have an unsatisfied basic need in relation to the supply of potable water if it does not reach the pipeline inside the house or if it does, the origin is not a general network or a protected upwelling. An index of unsatisfied basic needs (Necesidadas Basicas Insatisfechas) is used to measure poverty. NBI includes indicators such as access to clean water, quality of housing, crowding, education level and others. The census information was collected by the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica in Uruguay between September 1 and December 31 of 2011. The original questionnaire and other supporting documentation for this census is included with this download.",
