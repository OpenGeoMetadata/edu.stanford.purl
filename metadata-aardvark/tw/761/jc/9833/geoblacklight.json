    "This polyline shapefile depicts the public space Right of Way (ROW) centerlines for street segments managed by the County of San Mateo. When property is developed, property owners dedicate part of the land as public ROW for streets, sidewalks, utilities and similar public uses. Similarly, activities occuring in public ROW areas may require securing a permit. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for San Mateo County, California.",
    "This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
    "The County of San Mateo cannot vouch for the data or analyses derived from these data.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
