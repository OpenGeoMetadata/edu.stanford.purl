  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polyline shapefile provides temporal data on the size and growth rate of juvenile salmonids from Sausal Creek, a tributary of the Russian River, which were monitored over eight rearing seasons (1994-2001). Monitoring was conducted at the beginning (July) and end (October-November) of the summer dry period to enable estimation of juvenile growth rate.",
    "This dataset was conducted to evaluate spawning success, fry or fingerling production, and juvenile survivorship as part of a larger study examining the potential effects of reclaimed water discharged to Santa Rosa Creek by the Santa Rosa Subregional Reclamation System.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
