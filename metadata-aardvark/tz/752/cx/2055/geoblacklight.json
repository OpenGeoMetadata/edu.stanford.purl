    "Data for this service is derived from one of two sources: Rural Innovation Fund grantee applications describing proposed allocation areas using U.S. Census block geography, or block-level data identified and selected through the use of mapping tool available to applicants through HUDUSER.gov.  Each Grantee was allowed up to three target area locations according to the RIF NOFA. Some Grantee locations serve the same target areas so the map layer does include some overlapping boundaries.
