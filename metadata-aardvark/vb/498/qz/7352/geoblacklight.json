    "This county boundary polygon is based off of the parcel polygons, which are available from our Open Data Portal. This boundary polygon was generated by a Dissolve GP process. It is not to be used for legal purposes or border disputes, and is shared with the sole purpose of adding a reasonable estimate of the County Boundary in the spirit of general mapping purposes. The geometry of the parcel polygons, upon which this layer is based, are derived by a manual process of entering coordinate geometry as defined by a parcel's Deed. As not all Deeds agree with eachother, and some of the older definitions weren't perfectly accurate, this creates conflicts between parcels that inevitably lead to slight distortions. Again, these distortions are small enough to make the data useful for mapping purposes; to create a \"best available\" view of the state of the metes and bounds of the County and its subsequent parcels. This particular view has the CDN enabled in order for it to perform better for viral maps and apps.",
