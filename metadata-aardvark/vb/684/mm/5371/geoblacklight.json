    "First\nlaunched by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and\nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) in November 2013, the Location Affordability\nIndex (LAI) provides ubiquitous, standardized household housing and\ntransportation cost estimates for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Because\nwhat is affordable is different for everyone, users can choose among eight household\nprofiles—which vary by household income, size, and number of commuters—and see\nthe impact of the built environment on affordability in a given location while\nholding household demographics constant. \n\nVersion\n3 updates the constituent data sets with 2012-2016 American Community Survey\ndata and makes several methodological tweaks, most notably moving to modeling\nat the Census tract level rather at the block group. As with Version 2, the\ninputs to the simultaneous equation model (SEM) include six endogenous variables—housing\ncosts, car ownership, and transit usage for both owners and renters—and 18\nexogenous variables, with vehicle miles traveled still modeled separately due\nto data limitations.To learn more about the Location Affordability Index (v.3) visit: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/location-affordability-index/.Date of Coverage: 2012-2016 Data Dictionary: DD_Location Affordability Indev v.3.0LAI Version 3 Data and MethodologyLAI Version 3 Technical Documentation",
