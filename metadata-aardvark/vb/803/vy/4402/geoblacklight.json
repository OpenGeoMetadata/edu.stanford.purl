    "This polygon shapefile depicts natural and artificial lakes worldwide ranked by relative importance, coordinating with river ranking. Includes name attributes. Data was derived from the United States Central Intelligence Agency's World Data Bank 2 with numerous reservoir additions from other sources, primarily imagery. The diminishing areal extent of the Aral Sea and Lake Chad derives from more recent satellite imagery These data are represented at 1:10,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0).",
    "Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software."
