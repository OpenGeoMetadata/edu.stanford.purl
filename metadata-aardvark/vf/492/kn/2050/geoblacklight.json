    "This line shapefile represents sections of the California Coastal Trail in the San Mateo County Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment Project area. Data from the National Park Service (Golden Gate National Recreation Area and Point Reyes National Seashore), the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Coastal State Park Units), the California Coastal Commission (SB908), and Coastwalk (2008 alignment) were used to create this dataset. Starting with the SB908 and Coastwalk 2008 the alignment of the trail was reviewed by staff at the Conservancy for accuracy and to make sure that newly completed projects were included. Once the route was reviewed data was used from NPS, CDPR, and 1m images to digitize the new alignment. Where the CCT was already established by NPS or CDPR their alignment for the route was followed. This alignment of the CCT was created to update the SB908 (2002) alignment and the Coastwalk (2008) alignments to include new sections of the CCT. The new data is also intended to be significantly more accurate.Goal 1: Update the alignment (2012)Goal 2: Make the data usable at larger scales in web mapping applications.Goal 3: Only display the existing route available to the public. (No planned, proposed, or missing sections)This layer is part of the San Mateo County Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment Project.",
