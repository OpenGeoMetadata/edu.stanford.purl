    "The county parcel layer was derived over many years from the cadastral parcel maps prepared by the Assessor's Office. The complete and contiguous parcel fabric was then registered and rectified to the best available Public Land Survey (PLS) available. This PLS layer has many inherent inaccuracies related to the original surveys completed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As more accurate ground controls become available, the parcel layer will be adjusted. The parcel layer is currently updated roughly twice per year, based on changes to the cadastral maps by the assessor’s drafting function. This can result in delays of several months before updates due to land divisions, mergers, and boundary line adjustment are reflected in the parcel data sets used by these map pages. July 2023.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
