    "This polyline shapefile depicts most highways in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California and is not meant to be precisely accurate. These data were created from a variety of sources developed over the years, including data from ESRI, the California Department of Transportation, the United States Census Bureau Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER/Line) and counties. It is not meant to be precisely accurate and represents most of the major roads in the region. This was developed by the Conservation Lands Network and the GreenInfo Network.",
    "This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
