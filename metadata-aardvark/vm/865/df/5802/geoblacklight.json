  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This line shapefile represents the 12 nautical mile distance from the California coastline. It was created by buffering the county-coastline, which is a generalized coastline lacking detail such as rocks. The 12 nautical line is for display only and can not be used for navigation. It reflects 12 nm from a generalized land boundary, without rocks, and can not be used to calculate coastal area. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Deparmtent of Fish &amp; Game.",
    "The 12 nautical mile line images spatial relationship to coastline.",
    "The data may not be used for navigation. No guarantee is given regarding the accuracy of the data. It is for display only.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
