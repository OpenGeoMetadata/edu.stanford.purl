    "This polygon shapefile depicts increases and decreases in vegetative cover over 5 year periods in the Russian River Watershed region of California. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery is used to locate magnitudes of land cover change within five-year time periods across all vegetation types and ownerships. These data were derived from a California Dept. of Forestry and Fire coverage (2002).",
