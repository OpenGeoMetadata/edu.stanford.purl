    "This Priority Landscape (PL) shows priority areas for restoring pest and drought damaged forest areas. Restoration activities can be either treatments to protect public safety and infrastructure from falling trees and potential wildfire threat or to restore ecosystem services. Priority areas are derived directly from High Hazard Zones delineated by the Tree Mortality Task Force http://www.fire.ca.gov/treetaskforce/. Pest Damaged Areas: HHZ18_1 (in HighHazardZones18_1.gdb) identifies Tier 1 and Tier 2 High Hazard Zones delineated by the Tree Mortality Task Force as of 2018. Tier 1 High Hazard Zones: These are areas where tree mortality directly coincides with critical infrastructure. They represent direct threats. Tier 2 High Hazard Zones: These are areas defined by watersheds (HUC 12, average 24,000 acres) that have significant tree mortality as well as significant community and natural resource assets. This dataset was developed in 2018 to support the California Assessment of Forest and Rangelands.",
