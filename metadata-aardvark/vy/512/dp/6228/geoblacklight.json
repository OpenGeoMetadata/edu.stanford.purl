  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polygon shapefile represents road maintenance districts in Monterey County, California. Road maintenence districts provide specific services to the roads within a specified boundary established by the people in the area who request the road maintenance services. The level of service is determined by the needs and desires of the residents and what they are willing to pay on an annual basis. Unlike roads that are within the County Transportation Departmentâ€™s maintenance system, road maintenance districts do not receive any funds from gas tax revenue. All funding is generated from the parcels within the boundary of the area receiving benefit from the roads.This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Monterey County in California.",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data."
