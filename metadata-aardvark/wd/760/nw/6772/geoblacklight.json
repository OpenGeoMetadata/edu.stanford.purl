    "Summary\n\nThe\nLow Transportation Cost Index is based on estimates of transportation expenses\nfor a family that meets the following description: a 3-person single-parent\nfamily with income at 50% of the median income for renters for the region (i.e.\nCBSA). The estimates come from the Location Affordability Index (LAI). The data\ncorrespond to those for household type 6 (hh_type6_) as noted in the LAI data\ndictionary. More specifically, among this household type, we model\ntransportation costs as a percent of income for renters (t_rent). Neighborhoods\nare defined as census tracts. The LAI data do not contain transportation cost\ninformation for Puerto Rico.\n\nInterpretation\n\nValues are inverted\nand percentile ranked nationally, with values ranging from 0 to 100. The higher\nthe transportation cost index, the lower the cost of transportation in that\nneighborhood. Transportation costs may be low for a range of reasons, including\ngreater access to public transportation and the density of homes, services, and\njobs in the neighborhood and surrounding community.\n\nData Source: Location Affordability Index (LAI) data,\n2008-2012.Related AFFH-T Local Government, PHA and State Tables/Maps: Table 12; Map 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences: www.locationaffordability.info  https://lai.locationaffordability.info//lai_data_dictionary.pdf\n\n\n\n  \nTo learn more about the Low Transportation Cost Index visit: https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/4868/affh-raw-data/Date of Coverage: 02/2020",
