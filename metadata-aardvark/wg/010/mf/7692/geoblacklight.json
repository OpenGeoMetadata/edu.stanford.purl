    "This polygon shapefile contains the county boundaries of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, by showing the counties as areas. The map layer was created by extracting county polygon features from the CENSUS 2006 TIGER/Line files produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. These files were then merged into a single file. This is a revised version of the July 2012 map layer. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States.",
    "These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.",
    "None. Acknowledgment of The National Atlas of the United States of America would be appreciated in products derived from these data.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
