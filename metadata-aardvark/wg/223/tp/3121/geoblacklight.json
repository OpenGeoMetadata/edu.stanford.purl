    "This polygon dataset depicts various types of land use in Kabul city. Categories of land use include:, airports, cemeteries, agriculture fields, lakes, parks, stadiums, as well as urban and rural areas. These data were digitized from IKONOS satellite imagery (2000-2002) at 1:5,000 scale with one meter resolution (most of Kabul) and 2.5 meter resolution (areas outside of Kabul). This layer is part of the Topographic Maps of Afghanistan and Kabul dataset which contains shapefiles relating to district and provincial boundaries, land use, transportation, buildings and structures, rivers, settlements and other specific city data.",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data."
