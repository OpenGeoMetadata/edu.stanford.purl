    "On October 30, 2015 Governor Brown issued an emergency declaration requiring public agencies to identify areas of tree mortality that hold the greatest potential to result in wildfire and/or falling trees and threaten people and property in these areas. Once identified, these areas will be prioritized for removal of dead and dying trees that present a threat to public safety. Tier One High Hazard Zones are areas where assets to be protected and tree mortality directly coincide. These are the areas designated by state and local governments as being in greatest need of dead tree removal, pursuant to the California Governor's Emergency proclamation on October 30, 2015. These areas are considered as having the highest potential of being a safety issue to people, buildings and infrastructure. Dead trees heighten wildfire risk and can be hazardous if they fall. This service represents the latest official release of HHZ. It will be updated annually when a new version is released. As of June 2019, it represents HighHazardZones19_1.",
