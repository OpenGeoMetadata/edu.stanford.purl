    "These maps and data were created as part of the Authorial London project. The Authorial London application was implemented as an update for Dr. Martin Evan’s original 'Authorial London, a Student’s Guide.' This resource provides for the geographic exploration of London literature via its books and genres, its places, and biographies of its authors that lived and traveled through the region over the last 600 years. Authorial London is being developed by the Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (CIDR) in collaboration with the Digital Learning Strategy Group of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning."
