    "This polygon shapefile depicts the extent of area affected by the top twenty areas of stormwater discharge in the Southern California Bight. The original point data used to create these polygon features was summarized by Eric Steine (Southern California Coastal Water Research Project) in November 2008. Eric Steine used the following reference: Ackerman, D. and Schiff, K. 2003. Modeling storm water mass emissions to the Southern California Bight. Journal of Environmental Engineering 129 (4): 308-317.",
    "This coverage displays the extent of area around the location of the top twenty sites where storm water is discharged into the Southern California Bight, the curved coastline of Southern California between Point Conception and San Diego.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
