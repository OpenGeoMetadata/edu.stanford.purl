    "This polygon shapefile represents the department boundary of Martinique in 2010. These are the level 1 administrative divisions (ADM1). A region's primary responsibility is to build and furnish high schools. In addition, regions have considerable discretionary power over infrastructural spending, e.g., education, public transit, universities and research, and assistance to business owners.",
