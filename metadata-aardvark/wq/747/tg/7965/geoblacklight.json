    "This map illustrates satellite-detected, potentially damaged structures in the city of Izucar de Matamoros, Izucar de Matamoros Municipality, Puebla State, Mexico. The analyzed area is located approximately 7 km west from the epicenter of the 7.1M earthquake that struck the central eastern part of Mexico on 19 September 2017. UNITAR-UNOSAT identified 437 potentially damaged structures using a post-event Pleiades satellite image acquired on 21 September 2017 and a pre-event WorldView-2 satellite image acquired on 11 April 2017.",
    "This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation of flood waters. Users with specific questions or concerns should contact unosat@unitar.org to seek clarification.",
