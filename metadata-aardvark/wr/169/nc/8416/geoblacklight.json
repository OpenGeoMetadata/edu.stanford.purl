    "\t\t\tThe  HOME Investments Partnership Program (HOME) is a federal block grant program distributed (via formula) to states and local governments. Participating jurisdictions may use HOME funds for a variety of housing activities, according to local housing needs. Eligible uses of funds include: tenant-based rental assistance, housing rehabilitation, assistance to home-buyers, and new construction of housing.\t\t\t\tHOME funding may also be used for site acquisition, site improvements, demolition, relocation, and other necessary and reasonable activities related to the development of non-luxury housing. Funds may not be used for public housing development, public housing operating costs, or for Section 8 tenant-based assistance, nor may they be used to provide non-federal matching contributions for other federal programs, for operating subsidies for rental housing, or for activities under the Low-Income Housing Preservation Act.\t\t\t\tThe locations of HOME activities are derived from addresses provided by HUD grantees from 1996 to present in HUDs Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS). Until recently, these addresses were not validated at point of entry. The prevalence of missing or incorrect address data means that HUD cannot guarantee the accuracy of these locations. However, due to recent improvements to IDIS, HUD expects the quality of activity locations to improve over time. Please note that this service only provides data for those areas in which HOME program activity has occurred.\tPlease note that this service only provides data for those areas in which HOME program activity has occurred. Tracts where Total Activity Count = 0, or Total Activity Count is NULL have been omitted from this dataset.\t\t\tTo learn more about the HOME Program visit: https://www.hud.gov/hudprograms/home-program/ \t\t  \t\tData Dictionary: DD_Home Program Activity by Tract.  \t\t\t\tDate of Coverage: 10/2021\t\tLast Updated: 11/2021",
