    "This line shapefile represents the railroad network of India. This layer is part of the India State Basemap dataset containing district and sub-district boundaries, locations of cities and towns, villages over 5,000 population, highways and metalled roads, rail-routes and railway stations, airports, etc. Census demographic, socio-economic and communications data are also included for some layers.",
    "This shapefile can be used to identify railway lines in India. This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production."
