    "This polygon shapefile represents the open space easements transferred to the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District. This layer is one of seven GIS layers developed by the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District for use in developing the Acquisition Plan 2000: A Blueprint for Agricultural and Open Space Preservation.",
    "This shapefile provides a comprehensive strategy for targeting open space protection efforts in the highest priority areas. State law requires that each county and city prepare an Open Space Element as part of its General Plan that addresses how preservation of open space lands will be implemented. The 1989 Sonoma County General Plan implements legal requirements for preservation of open space land through various plan elements, including Open Space, Resource Conservation, Land Use, Public Safety, and Agricultural Resources.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
