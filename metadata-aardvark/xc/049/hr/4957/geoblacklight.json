    "This polygon shapefile represents the Canton Boundaries for the Orne department of France for 2010. These are the level 4 administrative divisions (ADM4) of Orne. The cantons of France are territorial subdivisions of the French Republic's 342 arrondissements and 101 departments. Apart from their role as organizational units in certain aspects of the administration of public services and justice, the chief purpose of the cantons today is to serve as constituencies for the election of the members of the representative assembly (General Council) in each department.",
