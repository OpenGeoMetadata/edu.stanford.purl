The Global Map Macedonia was developed by SAGW as e CAD data in dgn format, and then adapted in to Global Map standards. gmmk20 2011-11-01 2.0 Source data for creation the Global Mapping data are data from cadastral plans in scale 1:1000, 1:2500, 1:5000 and 1:10000 in raster form. All data are topologically correct. The boundaries are generalized according to the Global Mapping Specifications v.2 for scale 1:1000000. The geospatial data are transformed from the local Macedonian state coordinate system to WGS84, UTM 34 projection. The Global Map Macedonia - Drainage, Population Center and Transportation layer were developed by digitizing of the excisting maps in scale 1:200.000.",
