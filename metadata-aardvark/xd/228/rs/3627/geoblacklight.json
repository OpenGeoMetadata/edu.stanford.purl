    "This point shapefile represents the locations of refractory, abrasive, and other industrial minerals operations in the United States. The data represent commodities covered by the Minerals Information Team (MIT) of the U.S. Geological Survey, and the operations are those considered active in 2003 and surveyed by the MIT. This is a revised version of the June 2004 map layer. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition National Atlas of the United States.",
