    "The Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG), formally the Emergency Shelter Grants, program is designed to identify sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons, as well as those at risk of homelessness, and provide the services necessary to help those persons quickly regain stability in permanent housing after experiencing a housing crisis and/or homelessness. The ESG is a non-competitive formula grant awarded to recipients which are state governments, large cities, urban counties, and U.S. territories. Recipients make these funds available to eligible sub-recipients, which can be either local government agencies or private nonprofit organizations. The recipient agencies and organizations, which actually run the homeless assistance projects, apply for ESG funds to the governmental grantee, and not directly to HUD.\n  To learn more about the Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) Program visit: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/esg/\n  Data Dictionary: DD_ESG Grantee Areas\n\nDate of Coverage: 2018",
    "The purpose of the Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) program is to assist individuals and families regain stability in permanent housing following a crisis."
