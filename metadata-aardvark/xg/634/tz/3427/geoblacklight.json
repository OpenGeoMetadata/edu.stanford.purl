    "Promise Zones are high poverty communities where  the federal government partners with local leaders to increase economic  activity, improve educational opportunities, leverage private investment,  reduce violent crime, enhance public health and address other priorities  identified by the community. Current Promise Zones were selected through three  rounds of national competition, in which applicants demonstrated a consensus  vision for their community and its residents, the capacity to carry it out, and  a shared commitment to specific, measurable results.  The Promise Zone  designation partners the Federal government with local leaders who are  addressing multiple community revitalization challenges in a collaborative way.  The Promise Zone designation will last for a term of 10 years.  During  this term, the specific benefits made available to Promise Zones will vary from  year to year, and sometimes more often than annually, due to changes in the  agency policies and changes in appropriations and authorizations for relevant  programs.
