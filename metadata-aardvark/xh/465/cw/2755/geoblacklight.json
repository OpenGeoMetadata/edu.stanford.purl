    "This polygon shapefile is an index to 1:1,000,000 scale maps of Southeast Asia and Australia, titled 'Hyakumanbun no ichi kōkūzu.’ To create this index, footprints were generated using the fishnet tool, and metadata were supplied for the digitized paper maps by Stanford University Libraries. After the footprints were created, the shapefile was trimmed and labeled according to the sources.",
