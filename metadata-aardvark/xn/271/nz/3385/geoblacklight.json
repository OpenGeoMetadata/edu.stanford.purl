    "This polygon shapefile contains data of California-wide ecological units based on the interagency (USFS, BLM, NRCS) national mapping project known as ECOMAP. A hardcopy version of ECOMAP was developed and printed in 1994 (Bailey et al. 1994, Ecoregions and Subregions of the United States). A California subset of the map subsequently compiled and produced by the USFS Pacific Southwest Region (R5) Geometronics staff. The coverage name 'USDAECO' is local to DFG and represents the R5 edition map. USDA Forest Service (USFS), USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)(formerly Soil Conservation Service), USDI Bureau of Land Management (BLM), California Department of Fish and Game (DFG).",
