    "This dataset describes the instream habitat of the Mendocino County reach of the Russian River, from the confluence of the Russian River and the East Fork Russian River (just below Lake Mendocino), to sixty feet upstream from where the US Highway 101 Hopland Bridge crosses the Russian River. The dataset contains information describing the instream habitat in terms of habitat type, thalweg depth, substrate type, shelter rating, presence of Ludwigia spp. as well as erosional information. The instream habitat data which this file illustrates was collected between the months of September and October, 1992.",
    "This dataset is to be used in riparian ecosystem management, planning analysis, and impact assessment.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
