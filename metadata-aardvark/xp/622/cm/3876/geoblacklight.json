    "This polygon shapefile shows classifications of land ownership within the Russian River basin of California. These data were originally digitized by the Forest and Rangeland Resources Assessment Program of the California Department of Forestry. It was then registered to the Public Land Survey coverage at Teale Data Center to ensure thatcoincident lines would overlay properly. It is derived from 1:100,000 Bureau of Land Management Surface Management Status Maps. Some of these maps date back to the 1970's. The most recent national forest maps and other sources were used to update the BLM maps prior to digitizing.",
    "This layer can be used for watershed analysis and planning in the Russian River region of California.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
