  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This GeoTIFF is a representation of the coverage area for 3G mobile communications newtworks in Uzbekistan. Mobile Coverage is released annually in January each year. This data release is named 2020. Any operator data received up to the end of the year 2019 is included in this release. The data is made available in GeoTIFF 2-BIT raster format with pre-built pyramids using nearest-neighbour resampling - with a nominal resolution of approximately 260 metres on the ground at the equator. Operators are asked to submit strong (indoor) and variable (outdoor) signal strengths: 2G (GSM) Greater than / -92 dBm -92 to -100 dBm, 3G (UMTS) Greater than -92 dBm / -92 to -100 dBm, 4G (LTE) Greater than -105 dBm / -105 to -120 dBm. However, the data received from operators often does not include signal strength information or does not follow the above guidelines. Therefore, whilst the rasters retain the strong and variable distinctions, this inconsistency must be understood by the user.The cell values in the MCE rasters are as follows: 1 - strong signal strength 2 - variable signal strength."
