    "This line shapefile depicts the main stem of the Russian River in California. consists of flowing waters (rivers and streams), standing waters (lakes and ponds), and wetlands -- both natural and manmade. Two separate feature types are represented: polygons (areas) and lines. Polygon features have attribute codes that identify water bodies such as lakes, wide river segments, or swamps. Line features have attribute codes that represent streams or shorelines. This layer does not include the many tributaries to the Russian River.",
    "This dataset is intended to assist in watershed planning and analysis.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
