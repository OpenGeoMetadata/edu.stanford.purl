    "This point shapefile contains the locations of intermodal rail terminals in California as of 2013. Intermodal freight facilities are transfer points to move freight from ship to rail or truck. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
    "This is Category I data. Category I data are public domain and available to share with Caltrans partners. Caltrans makes no representation about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, or accuracy of its GIS data for any purpose. The GIS data and information are provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind. Use of the data should be limited to informational and preliminary study purposes only. Caltrans shall not be held liable by users of the data, or by any other party, for any loss or damages, consequential or otherwise, including but not limited to time, money, or goodwill, arising from the use, operation or modification of the data. For planning purposes only. The Rail Database is intended for high level planning purposes and is a point in time reporting of estimated current conditions and forecast of future conditions. While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy of reported data, the Database is not intended for detailed service or facility planning. Such planning requires in-depth site analysis and field confirmation of actual conditions.",
