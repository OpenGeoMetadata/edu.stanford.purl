    "Region between the Caspian and the Sea of China, much of which is deemed Terra Incognita in the north and east. Showing stylized mountain ranges and city names drawn from Ptolemy, this map is based upon 2000-year old geography, while contemporary editions certainly had better indications. Taken as \"Lib. III. page. 884\" from an early edition of Cellarius' Notitia Orbis Antiqui, Sive Geographia Plenior ... et Novis Tabulis Geographicis, which was published in London, Amsterdam, and other places over the next 1000 years and was one of the most popular Ancient Geographies of its time. Cartouche in the upper right-hand corner showing an assembled crowd of soldiers under a laurel wreath and emblem of spears and shields, apparently celebrating victory around a pile of arms.",
    "Pictorial relief.",
    "Latitude degrees in margin.",
    "Shows waterways, cities (with the major ones illustrated)."
