    "This polygon shapefile represents best estimates of ward and constituency boundaries in Zambia based on available sources. The primary source for this layer is a set of printed maps of 2006-2010 ward and constituency boundaries provided by the Election Commission of Zambia (ECZ) to the author. However, these printed maps had three issues: (1) The packet was incomplete (maps for some constituencies and districts showed planned post-2010 ward boundaries rather than 2006-2010 actual wards); (2) The different layers in the file -- boundary edges, geographic features, and city locations -- had misalignments in many places, making it impossible to use geographic features for geo-referencing; (3) Some (small) wards could not be distinguished from one another in the printed maps. As a result: (1) Not all wards are included (see ward names and codes in the attribute definitions); (2) Georeferencing was primarily accomplished by matching stretches of constituency boundaries in the 2006-2010 maps with those in a Zambian Central Statistics Office-provided map of constituency and ward boundaries from the 2001-2005 period that had clearly not been changed between 2005 and 2006. Some additional inferences were made using of satellite maps of rivers and cities where boundaries were clearly drawn to follow rivers or large roads; (3) some wards have been merged into single polyons.",
