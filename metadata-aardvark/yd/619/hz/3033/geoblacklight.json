    "This map denotes the locations of HUD assisted Multi-Family properties that primarily serve elderly residents. In addition, each property illustrated through this service has at least one active Service Coordinator contract or grant, Section 236 loan, Section 8 202 contract, Section 8 Farmers Home Administration (FMHA) 515 contract, Section 8 New Construction contract, Section 202 Project Assistance Contracts (PAC) contract, and Section 202 Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC).Please note that the data provided through this map only includes location data and attributes for those addresses that can be geocoded to an interpolated point along a street segment, or to a ZIP+4 centroid location. While not all records are able to be geocoded and mapped, we are continuously working to improve the address data quality and enhance coverage.
