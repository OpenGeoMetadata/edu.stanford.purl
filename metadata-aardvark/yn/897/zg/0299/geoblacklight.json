  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This polyline shapefile depicts stream and fish data that Leidy compiled over decades of research in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California. In his research for the following paper, Essential Watersheds and Priority Stream Segments for Focused Conservation Actions to Protect Native Fishes, San Francisco Estuary, California (2008), Robert A. Leidy identified native fish species in the vast majority of streams draining into San Francisco Bay. This is valuable data for developing the Conservation Lands Network.",
    "This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
