  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This line shapefile describes the instream habitat of the Alexander Valley Reach of the Russian River and extends along the mainstem of the river, from the confluence of Big Sulphur Springs to the intersection of the mainstem and the Alexander Valley Bridge, and contains information that describes the instream habitat in terms of habitat type, thalweg depth, substrate type, shelter rating, presence of Ludwigia spp. as well as erosional information. This data gathering effort was a component of the Russian River Resource Enhancement and Access Plan's Instream Habitat Inventory, and was collected between the months of July and August, 1992.",
    "This dataset is intended to be used for characterizing instream habitat parameters in the mainstem of the Russian River, Mendocino County reach.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
