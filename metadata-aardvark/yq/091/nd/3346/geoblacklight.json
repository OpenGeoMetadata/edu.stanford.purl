    "The Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS) is an automated file that contains information on wrecks and obstructions, and other significant charted features in coastal waters of the United States subject to NOS Hydrographic Surveys. Items in this file are individually catalogued and are accompanied by historic and descriptive information gathered from field observations and Government and private publications. Approximately 96% of the items have a position in latitude and longitude (NAD83), original datum information, a position accuracy code, a source quality code, a charted symbol code, a chart number, and project information. Each item has also been evaluated for the adequacy of the available information as it relates to future surveys and nautical charting activities and may carry a specific recommendation for the type of survey investigation required to improve the quality of known information",
