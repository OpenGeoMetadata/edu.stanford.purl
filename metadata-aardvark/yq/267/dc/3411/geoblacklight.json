    "ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD INDEXSummary\n\nThe environmental health hazard exposure index\nsummarizes potential exposure to harmful toxins at a neighborhood level.\nPotential health hazards exposure is a linear combination of standardized EPA\nestimates of air quality carcinogenic (c), respiratory (r) and\nneurological (n) hazards with i indexing census tracts.\n\nWhere means  and standard\nerrors  are estimated over\nthe national distribution.\n\n Interpretation\n\nValues are inverted and then percentile ranked\nnationally. Values range from 0 to 100. The higher the index value, the less\nexposure to toxins harmful to human health. Therefore, the higher the value,\nthe better the environmental quality of a neighborhood, where a neighborhood is\na census block-group.\n\nData Source: National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) data, 2011.\nRelated AFFH-T Local Government, PHA and State Tables/Maps: Table 12; Map 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences: https://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/natamain/\n\n\n\n  \nTo learn more about the Environmental Health Hazard Index visit: https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/4868/affh-raw-data/Date of Coverage: 02/2018",
