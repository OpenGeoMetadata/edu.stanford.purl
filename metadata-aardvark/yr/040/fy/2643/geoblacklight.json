    "This polygon file depicts boundaries of the nine counties in the San Francisco Bay Area Region, California. The Bay Area Open Space Council officially included Santa Cruz county in the Conservation Lands Network as of 2010. This data was originally derived from the United States Census Bureau Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing GIS database called TIGER/Line. This coverage is a common base layer used for reference, to identify what county data is within, as well as for cartographic purposes.",
    "This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
