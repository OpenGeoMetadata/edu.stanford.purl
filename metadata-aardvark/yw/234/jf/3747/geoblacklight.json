    "This line shapefile depicts the political boundaries of North America, including: international boundaries, provincial boundaries, state or territory boundaries, and the International Date Line. This layer is the result of a joint venture involving the National Atlas programs in Canada (Natural Resources Canada), Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática), and the United States (U.S. Geological Survey), as well as the North American Commission for Environmental Co-operation. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States.",
    "The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national and continental level. These data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática, or the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.",
    "All data for Canada and other areas outside of Mexico and the United States of America are covered by the Geogratis User Agreement for Digital Data. No use constraints are applied to data for Mexico and the United States of America.
