    "This polygon shapefile contains the municipality boundaries for the Republic of Georgia. These are the level 2 administrative divisions (ADM2). Each municipality contains the population count from the 1989 Soviet census. A municipality is a subdivision of Georgia, consisting of a settlement or a group of settlements, which enjoys local self-government. There are two types of municipalitiesâ€”self-governing cities, 12 in total, and self-governing communities, 64 in total. This layer is part of a collection of data relating to administrative units in the Republic of Georgia.",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data."
