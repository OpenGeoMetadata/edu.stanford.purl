    "This polygon shapefile depicts boundaries for Congressional Districts 3, 6, 7 and 9 for the County of Sacramento, California as of 2015. Current Congressional District boundaries were drawn in 2011 by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission and took effect with the 2012 election. California is the most populous state in the United States, so has the most representation in the United States House of Representatives, with each Representative representing one Congressional District. The United States is divided into 435 Congressional Districts — 53 in California — each with a population of about 710,000 individuals. Each District elects a representative to the House for a 2 year term. This layer is part of a collection of data originally produced for Sacramento County, California.",
