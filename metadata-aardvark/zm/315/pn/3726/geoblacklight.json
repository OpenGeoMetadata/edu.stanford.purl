    "Shows the Tatar Empire and European Russia all the way to the \"Chinese\" ocean and the beginnings of the Korean Peninsula. Starting with Archangelsk and Nizhnyi Novgorod in the west - the upper left corner - the settlements on the Volga are shown through to Astrakhan, but the area is labeled generally as \"Bulgaria.\" The Caspian is depicted oblong horizontally, which was common of seventeenth century maps. Moving east into Siberia, Tyumen (\"Tumen\") is shown with the Siberian rivers in a fairly accurate location. However, the source of the Ob is shown as \"Kitkay Lacus\" which as depicted appears more like the Aral Sea. Central Asia is depicted with numerous settlements along the Silk Road, some with names lost to history and others with their current names, leading to Tashkent beyond the \"Karakitay\" mountains. The south west is bordered by \"Persiae Pars\" and the south by \"Magni Mogoli Imperii Pars.\" The various \"Tatar\" or \"Mongol\" tribes are placed around the map. Lake Baikal (\"Lacus Cincui Hay\") depicted in accurate form just outside the Great Wall of China.",

    "Bar scale: \"Miliaria Germanica comunica.\"",
    "Shows waterways, cities (with various illustrations), woods.",
    "Descriptive text on map.",
    "Various illustrations on map, including warriors and Great Wall of China."
