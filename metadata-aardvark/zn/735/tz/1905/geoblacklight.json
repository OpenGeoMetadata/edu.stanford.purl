    "This line shapefile represents the truck network in California as of 2011. This layer shows sanctioned routes for commercial truck traffic located on the state highway system, and provides details on state truck route segments and their truck access designations (such as National Network, Terminal Access, California Legal, Advisory, or Restricted) with each segment's beginning and ending postmiles, and beginning and ending cross streets. The truck network routes were identified and extracted from State Highway Network based on the California \"Truck Network\" Route List (Caltrans Legal Truck Size &amp; Weight Work Group, March 30, 2011). ). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
