    "ALPAGE is a geohistorical platform about Paris. Based on a work dynamic initiated in 2006 with support from the French National Research Agency (ANR) this work then continued on beyond the funded phase (2006-2010). The initial project brought together twenty researchers in Social and Human Sciences and in Information and Communication Technology. Coordinated by Hélène Noizet, these historians, geomaticians and computer scientists have laid the foundations of a Geographic Information System (GIS) of the pre-industrial Parisian area. The spatial reference data, produced for the beginning of the 19th century and for the medieval period, have been made freely available online on a webmapping platform and is also available for download. A considerable amount of data has been produced not only on the medieval period but also on the modern period and on the 19th century. As regards to the geographical scale of the project, which remains limited to Paris, a partnership with the programme Archéologies du Bassin Parisien of the UMR 7041 ArScAn has enabled access to geohistorical frameworks across the Parisian basin.",
