  "dct_description_sm": [
    "The large map of the west is one of the most interesting and beautiful government maps of the 1840's. It filled in many of the gaps in cartographic knowledge of the west. Charles Preuss was the cartographer. Map is without color. Book is bound with full leather with \"Executive Documents 2d Sess. 28th Cong.\" on the spine in gold. Appears in \"Report of The Exploring Expedition to The Rocky Mountains in the Year 1842, and to Oregon and North California in the Years 1843-'44.\"",
    "The historic map layers in the Google Earth Rumsey Map Collection have been selected by David Rumsey from his large collection of historical maps, as well as some from other collections with which he collaborates. All the maps contain rich information about the past and represent a sampling of time periods, scales, and cartographic art, resulting in visual history stories that only old maps can tell. Each map has been georeferenced by Rumsey, thus creating unique digital map images that allow the old maps to appear in their correct places on the modern globe. Some of the maps fit perfectly in their modern spaces, while othersgenerally earlier period mapsreveal interesting geographical misconceptions of their time. Cultural features on the maps can be compared to the modern satellite views using the slider bars to adjust transparency. The result is an exploration of time as well as space, a marriage of historic cartographic masterpieces with innovative contemporary software tools.",
