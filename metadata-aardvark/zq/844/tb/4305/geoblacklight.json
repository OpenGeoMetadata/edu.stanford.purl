  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This line shapefile contains the national highway system (NHS) of California as of 2013. Under Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21), the enhanced NHS is composed of rural and urban roads nationwide serving major population centers, international border crossings, intermodal transportation facilities, and major travel destinations. The NHS includes the interstate system, other principal arterials, and border crossings on those routes (including other urban and rural principal arterial routes, and border crossings on those routes, that were not included on the NHS before the date of enactment of the MAP-21), intermodal connectors (highways that provide motor vehicle access between the NHS and major intermodal transportation facilities), and the Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET), the network of highways important to U.S. strategic defense, including connectors to major military installations. On October 1, 2012 the existing National Highway System (NHS) was expanded to include all existing Principal Arterials (i.e. Functional Classifications 1, 2 and 3) to the new enhanced NHS. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",

    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
