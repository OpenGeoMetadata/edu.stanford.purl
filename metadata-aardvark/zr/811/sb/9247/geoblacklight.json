    "This polyline shapefile depicts distribution of surf grass along the California Coast. This data was extracted from a larger set of data which contained plant species found along the coast derived from the Minerals Management Service (MMS) maps data for the Pacific Coast intertidal shorelines of the Monterey Bay, Gulf of the Farallones and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries.This data describes shoreline habitat characteristics and biological assemblages on United States Geologic Survey (USGS) quad maps.",
    "This coverage delineates areas of Surf Grass along the California coast.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
