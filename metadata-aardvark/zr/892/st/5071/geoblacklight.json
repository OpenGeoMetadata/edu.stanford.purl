    "This polygon shapefile depicts Endemic Bird Areas (EBAs) in Kenya. EBAs are sites where two or more bird species of \"restricted range\" (less than 50,000 sq km) occur together in the same area. Most of Kenyaâ€™s EBAs are located outside of parks and other protected areas, and all overlap or border densely settled, intensively farmed landscapes.",
