  "dct_description_sm": [
    "This raster layer is a georeferenced image of 1992 land cover for the conterminous United States, at a resolution of 200 meters. The map layer was compiled by staff in the National Land Cover Characterization Program of the U.S. Geological Survey National Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science, from data produced for the 1992 National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). The NLCD used Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite data. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States.",
    "These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the continental level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey or the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.",
    "This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection."
