    "This point shapefile depicts grade crossings and originates from the National Highway-Rail Crossing Inventory Program. A crossing is defined as those tracks that exist between a pair of the same type of warning devices. This layer is part of the 2014 National Transportation Atlas Database.",
    "The National Transportation Atlas Databases 2014 (NTAD2014) is a set of nationwide geographic datasets of transportation facilities, transportation networks, associated infrastructure and other political and administrative entities. These datasets include spatial information for transportation modal networks and intermodal terminals, as well as the reÂ¬lated attribute information for these features. This data supports research, analysis, and decision-making across all transportation modes. It is most useful at the national level, but has major applications at regional, state and local scales throughout the transportation community. The data used to compile NTAD2014 was provided by our partners within the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and by other agencies throughout the United States Federal Government. These contributors are the actual data stewards and are ultimately responsible for the maintenance and accuracy of their data. The purpose of Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Office of Safety Analysis data is to make railroad safety information, including accidents and incidents, inventory and highway-rail crossing data, readily available to the public. Rail crossings is a spatial file maintained by the FRA for use by states and railroads and the data is used by federal, state and local governments, as well as the railroad industry, for the improvement of safety at highway-rail crossings."
