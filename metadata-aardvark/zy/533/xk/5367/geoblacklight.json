    "This line shapefile shows the estimated major fault lines in Monterey Bay, California. These data were digitized from \"Fault Activity Map of California and Adjacent Areas\" (1994) and \"Geology of the Central California Continental Margin\" (1989). Shapefiles for this layer are available in WGS84 and UTM Zone 10 (NAD83) projections. This layer is part of the GIS Data of the Monterey Bay collection, a compilation of data and imagery of the Monterey Bay area, including coastline, imagery, and bathymetry.",
    "This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. This collection of data provides documented layers of of the Monterey Bay to persons/institutions of interest throughout the research and educational communities."
