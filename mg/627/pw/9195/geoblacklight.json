  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains imprecise locations of masonry wall remains in Paris based on archaeological references. The points contained in this layer lack the precise information to accurately locate them geographically. These point locations were gathered from archaeological documentation (textual descriptions), or from sources which could no be precisely geolocated. The work of gathering the archaeological information was directed by Etienne Lardkhan. (Univ. Paris-1, ed. D. Aina-Deroin and H. Noizet, 2007-2008).The ALPAGE programme aims to provide collaborative tools for the Humanities and Social Sciences and for Information Communication Technology (ICT) allowing for the development of research about the Parisian urban area. This aim is achieved by means of a GIS that includes cadastral and historical layers.",
