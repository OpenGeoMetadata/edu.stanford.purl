  "dc_description_s": "The Federal Housing Administration, generally known as \"FHA\", provides mortgage insurance on loans made by FHA-approved lenders throughout the United States and its territories. FHA insures mortgages on single family and multifamily homes including manufactured homes and hospitals. It is the largest insurer of mortgages in the world, insuring over 34 million properties since its inception in 1934. The insurance in force represents the outstanding balance of an active loan. Location data for HUD-related properties and facilities are derived from HUD's enterprise geocoding service. While not all records are able to be geocoded and mapped, we are continuously working to improve the address data quality and enhance coverage. Note that this file only includes x, y coordinates and associated attributes for those addresses that can be geocoded to an interpolated point along a street segment, or to the centroid of the nearest U.S. Census block. Please consider this issue when using any datasets provided by HUD. Data is current as of 09/30/2016. This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)
