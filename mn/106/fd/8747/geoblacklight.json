The short form contains items that reflect the basic situation of the population, while the long form includes all short form items plus other items such as migration, education, economic activities, marriage and family, fertility , housing , etc. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the households for the Long Form survey were selected by a random sampling program. The data included in these maps are from 100% Short Form survey (A variables) and 10% Long Form survey (L variables). Reference time for the Census is: 00:00AM, November 1, 2010. The 2010 Census covered all 2,872 counties, districts and autonomous regions of Mainland China and includes all persons who hold the nationality of, and have permanent residing place in the People's Republic of China.
