  "dc_title_s": "Flood Insurance Rate Map Bench Marks: Santa Cruz County, California, 2015",
  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Permanent bench marks for streams in the County of Santa Cruz, California. These bench marks must meet the requirements specified in Subsection 1.4.1.4.1 of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners. Horizontal coordinates maintained by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) for vertical Bench Marks are often not very precise because the users rely on the location descriptions to locate the bench marks rather than coordinates. If the source of the horizontal coordinates used by the NGS is not precise, the data creator may adjust the position based on more accurate data. The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by FEMA. The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system. The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California.The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. The GIS Unit serves all County departments and external customers and provides data on land, features and people of Santa Cruz County. Santa Cruz County encompasses 4 cities and approximately 265,000 people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
