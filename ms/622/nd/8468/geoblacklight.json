  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile shows the percentage of woodlots in sampled cropland in central and western Kenya, 1997. Areas with higher percentages of woodlots cluster more extensively in the foothills of the Aberdare Range and Mount Kenya, and in most communities of Central Kisii, Nyamira, and Buret Districts. A relatively large area of the upper parts of Maragua and Muranga Districts is covered by cropland where woodlots cover more than 12 percent of the land. Close proximity to densely settled rural and urban areas, as well as other centers of high wood demand (for example, tea production) are among the factors behind these spatial patterns. The share of woodlots is much lower in the western parts of the country. Farmers also do not plant woodlots in the more marginal cropping areas with lower rainfall, such as Makueni, Kitui, Mbeere, or Tharaka Districts. Note that these farmers may still plant trees for other purposes and that woodlots are only one of many sources for firewood (other sources include vegetation used to demarcate boundaries, or vegetation on cropland).This data was used in Map 7.3 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being.",
