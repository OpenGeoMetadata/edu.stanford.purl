  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset is a high-resolution bathymetric grid of the seafloor area located within the Russian River Watershed region of California. This grid was originally produced by the California Department of Fish and Game and was reprojected to UTM NAD83 Zone 10 North for inclusion in the Russian River Watershed GIS (RRGIS). Eez1000 is a 1000 meter resolution statewide bathymetric dataset that generally covers the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), an area extending 200 nautical miles from all United States possessions and trust territories. The data was adapted from isobath values ranging from 200 meters to 4800 meters below sea level; therefore nearshore depictions are not accurate and \"flatten out\" between 200 meter depths and the coastline. The data is intended only for general portrayals of offshore features and depthsSea Beam is used to map the continental slopes, rises, and the abyss where water depth is greater than 500m and results in high-resolution profiles of bathymetry. The Department of Fish and Game acquired this United States Geological Survey dataset indirectly through the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, and as a courtesy of Ecological Consultants, Inc. Please see the attached file \"metabath.txt\" for further source data information.This topography can be used to identify and characterize deep water features of the seafloor to reveal upwelling-producing canyons, ridges, and escarpments. Digital data can be correlated with sea surface temperature and chlorophyll, and distribution of marine birds, mammals, and fishes/invertebrates.",
