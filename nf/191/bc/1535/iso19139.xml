      <abstract>
        <gco:CharacterString>This polygon shapefile depicts kelp beds along the California coast, a critical habitat for many species of invertebrates, fish and marine mammals. Title 14, California Code of Regulations, designates 87 'Administrative Kelp Beds' for the purposes of managing commercial kelp harvest. The 87 kelp beds extend from the United States-Mexico border to the California-Oregon border and surround each of the Channel Islands. Each kelp bed falls within one of the following management categories: open, closed, leaseable and lease only. Open kelp beds are available to commercial kelp harvest, leases cannot be issued. Closed kelp beds are closed to all kelp harvesting. Leaseable kelp beds are available for kelp harvesting until the bed is leased, at which time only the lessee may harvest. Lease only kelp beds are closed to all kelp harvesting unless an exclusive lease is obtained. Kelp beds which are leased are desiginated as such. The status of the "leased" and "leaseable" beds may change and that users should check with the Department of Fish and Game for current status. Closed beds are listed in Title 14, California Code of Regulations, section 165(c)(5). Open beds area listed in Title 14, section 165.5(k). This layer is current as of August 2004.</gco:CharacterString>

Fish and Game Code, Chapter 6 General Provisions Sections 6650-6657 Royalty Payment Section 6680 Exclusive Leases Sections 6700-6711 Kelp Bed Status Fish and Game Commission Regulations, Title 14 General License Provisions Section 165 Kelp Bed Leases Section 165.5 SHAPEFILE DESCRIPTION Kelp beds along the coast of California are a critical habitat for many important sport and commercial species of invertebrates and fishes. The 87 kelp beds extend from the U.S.A.-Mexico International Boundary to the California-Oregon Boundary. They also surround the following islands, Anacapa, San Clemente, San Miguel, San Nicolas, Santa Barbara, Santa Catalina, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa. The boundaries of the Administrative Kelp Beds were prepared by DFG. The divisions between the Administrative Kelp Beds are defined by bearings projected westerly from features along the California coastline (example: From a line drawn 156&#xB0; from Malibu Pt. to a line drawn 185&#xB0; from Pt. Dume. 0.21 square miles). The features were located by using the California geographic names database or from features located on the U.S.G.S. quad maps. The bearings were projected westerly to a buffered 3 mile line (statue miles). The buffer is from a 100k coastline prepared by the Teale Data Center. ARC/INFO was used to create polygons of the areas encompassing the California shoreline, buffered 3 mile line and the projected bearings from the legal description. Intended uses of these maps include kelp bed lease identification and management. See also GIS datasets on the California Coastal Kelp Resources statewide survey from 1989 (Revision 1): scanned kelp maps, index shapefile (kelp1989.shp), and metadata (kelp1989.txt).

(a) The commission may lease to any person the exclusive privilege to harvest kelp in any designated kelp bed or beds, or part thereof described in subsection (j). (b) Any person desiring to lease the exclusive privilege of harvesting kelp shall make a written application to the Fish and Game Commission, 1416 Ninth Street, Sacramento, CA 95814. The application for kelp bed lease shall include: (1) The number of the designated bed or beds as shown in subsection (j), a description of the kelp bed or portion of the kelp bed requested and the designated number of square miles in each bed or portion thereof applied for. (2) A minimum deposit of $2,565 per square mile for kelp beds lying south of Point Arguello and $1,368 per square mile for kelp beds lying north of Point Arguello. (The deposit shall be returned to the applicant if a lease is not executed.) (3) A detailed development plan for the proposed kelp bed lease showing the intended use, the manner of harvesting and transporting the kelp and the amount of kelp the lessee proposes to harvest during each of the next five years. (4) The financial capabilities of the lessee to carry out the proposed plan of development. The department shall evaluate the submitted plans, and provide its evaluation to the commission. (5) Applicants for the lease of Kelp Beds 300-312 shall, in addition to the above requirements, submit evidence of a scientifically acceptable survey of the requested kelp bed, conducted within one year of the date of the application, showing the extent of the kelp bed and the quantity (biomass) of kelp present. Evidence of such a survey must be submitted annually prior to beginning harvest. Harvest of bull kelp from leased beds shall be limited to not more than 15 percent of the bull kelp biomass revealed by the survey. (c) Kelp leases may be awarded to applicants determined by the commission to possess the capabilities to harvest and utilize kelp in a manner beneficial to the state. (1) In case more than one application is received for the lease of a specified kelp bed or beds, the lease shall be awarded to the highest qualified bidder. (2) Bids tendered for the exclusive right to harvest kelp from designated kelp beds will be for the dollar amount of royalty to be paid on each wet ton of kelp harvested. The minimum acceptable bed will be for a royalty rate of no less than $1.71 per wet ton of kelp harvested. (3) The commission may reject any or all applications for the lease of the exclusive privilege to harvest kelp, if it deems the rejection to be in the public interest. (d) If the specified kelp harvesting area applied for is found to be available for lease, and that the lease would be in the public interest, the commission shall have legal notices published in a newspaper of general circulation in each county where the kelp bed, or any part thereof, is located. The department shall, in addition, notify by mail all current holders of kelp harvesting licenses that a kelp lease is being considered.

(f) Kelp bed leases shall be awarded for a maximum term of 20 years. (g) The royalty rate for kelp harvested from leased kelp beds shall be no less than $1.71 per wet ton of kelp harvested from such beds. A non-refundable advance payment computed on the basis of the harvest of 800 tons of kelp annually times the bid royalty rate per square mile for kelp beds located north of Point Arguello and the harvest of 1.500 tons of kelp annually times the bid royalty rate per square mile for beds lying south of that point is due and payable to the department on January 1 each year. Kelp harvested from each bed during the calendar year will be credited against the advance payment at the specified royalty rate until the deposit has been depleted. Kelp harvest from each bed in excess of the amount covered by the advance deposit shall be assessed at the basic royalty rate established by Section 165(c)(5). (h) Each kelp lease shall specify a period prior to expiration when renewal of the lease may be requested by lessee. If during the notification period the lessee successfully demonstrates to the commission that all conditions of the lease have been met, the lessee shall have a prior right to renew the lease on terms agreed upon between the commission and the lessee. If terms of a lease renewal are not agreed upon prior to termination of a lease agreement, the commission shall advertise for bids on the individual kelp beds comprising the lease. If a request for renewal is not made during the specified period by the lessee, the commission shall advertise for bids on the individual kelp beds comprising the lease. (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (f) and (h), at any time during the term of a lease, a lessee may notify the commission of its desire to enter into a new lease. If the lessee can successfully demonstrate to the commission that all conditions of its lease have been met and that a new lease would be in the best interest of the state, a new lease may be drawn on terms agreed upon between the two parties, provided a new lease is negotiated for an additional period not to exceed 20 years.
