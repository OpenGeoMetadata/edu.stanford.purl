  "dc_description_s": "This map layer contains locations and information on faults and associated folds, in the United States, that are believed to be sources of significant earthquakes (those of magnitude 6 or greater) during the past 1,600,000 years. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition National Atlas of the United States. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:250,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data. National Atlas of the United States. (2005). Quaternary Fault and Fold Database of the United States (Polygons). National Atlas of the United States. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/nj368fm1464. The most up-to-date version of this data set as well as detailed descriptions and references for each fault are available through the online Quaternary Fault and Fold Database of the United States, at <http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/qfaults/>. In addition, in the Earthquake Hazards Program Quaternary Faults and Fold Database viewer <http://gldims.cr.usgs.gov/qfault/viewer.htm>, and in the National Atlas Map Maker <http://nationalatlas.gov/mapmaker>, the geologic structures are linked to the database. The Quaternary Fault and Fold Database of the United States is intended to be the USGS archive for historic and ancient earthquake sources used in current and future probabilistic seismic-hazard analyses. The database summarizes important information on paleoseismic (ancient earthquake) parameters, compiled from thousands of journal articles, maps, theses, and other documents. It includes information on geographic, geologic, and paleoseismic parameters that are deemed critical to making geologic-based assessments of seismic hazards. In addition, it provides narrative comments that clarify, justify, or expound upon these parameters. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
