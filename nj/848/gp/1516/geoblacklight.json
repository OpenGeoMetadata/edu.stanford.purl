  "dc_description_s": "These are digital boundaries for the system of Civil Parishes which was and is the most detailed level of local administration in England and Wales, although in many areas parish councils are now moribund. This system was created in the mid-nineteenth century, although based on an earlier system of Ancient Parishes which were primarily ecclesiastical. This file represents the system as it was used to report the 1951 Census of Population. To distinguish between identical place names with different administrative geographies, an Administrative County Boundaries layer may be used to add County name attributes to this layer.
