  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts boundaries of Potential Liquefaction from Slope Stability Zones in the County of Humboldt, California. According to the United States Geological Survey, liquefaction is the ability of materials, such as clay, sand and gravel, to momentarily lose their ability to support surface structures, including roads, in the event of an earthquake.The Humboldt County Planning and Building Department is responsible for protecting the public health, safety and welfare via building permit review and inspections consistent with California model codes as well as planning and development review and approval consistent with the county's General Plan. This Department oversees the Advance Planning Division, which is responsible for the Humboldt County's Geographic Information System (GIS) that is utilized by other County Departments; many federal, state and local agencies; and the general public. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
