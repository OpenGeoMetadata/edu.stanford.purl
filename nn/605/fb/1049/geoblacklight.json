  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile is an alignment of data sources identifying trails which are part of the California Coastal Trail (CCT). This alignment of the CCT was created to update the SB908 (2002) alignment and the Coastwalk (2008) alingments to include new sections of the CCT. The new data is also intended to be significantly more accurate. Goal 1: Update the alignment (2012). Goal 2: Make the data usable at larger scales in web mapping applications. Goal 3: Only display the existing route available to the public. (No planned, proposed, or missing sections. Starting with the SB908 and Coastwalk 2008 the alignment of the trail was reviewed by staff at the Conservancy for accuracy and to make sure that newly completed projects were included. Once the route was reviewed data was used from NPS, CDPR, and 1m images to digitize the new alignment. Where the CCT was already established by NPS or CDPR their alignment for the route was followed. Sources: National Park Service - Golden Gate National Recreation Area and Point Reyes National Seashore, California Department of Parks and Recreation (Coastal State Park Units), California Coastal Commission (SB908), Coastwalk (2008 alignment). These data are intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.
