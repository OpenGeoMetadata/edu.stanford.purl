  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts grazing lands in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California. This data was derived from the California Department of Conservation Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP) data. The counties were merged into one dataset. The Grazing category was extracted from each county to create this dataset. Attributes are as follow: Grazing Land (G). It should be noted that each county maps each FMMP cateogory a bit differently, and therefore grazing may be defined differently by each county. This dataset was used more to get a sense of the overall scale of Grazing Lands in the region versus specific areas or acreages. This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.
