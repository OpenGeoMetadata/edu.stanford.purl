  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile contains topographic contours for Kabul, Afghanistan at 50-meter intervals. This layer was mapped by the International Securiity Assistance Force (ISAF) at 1:5,000 scale from one meter IKONOS satellite imagery. This layer is part of the Topographic Maps of Afghanistan and Kabul dataset which contains shapefiles relating to district and provincial boundaries, land use, transportation, buildings and structures, rivers, settlements and other specific city data. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.
