  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District in the County of Santa Cruz, California. However, district boundaries do extend in neighboring counties, so Santa Cruz County contains only a small portion of the larger District. The Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District is a regional greenbelt system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California that is comprised of over 60,000 acres of land in 26 open space preserves. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California. The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. The GIS Unit serves all County departments and external customers and provides data on land, features and people of Santa Cruz County. Santa Cruz County encompasses 4 cities and approximately 265,000 people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data. County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. (2015). Open Space Districts: Santa Cruz County, California, 2015. Santa Cruz County, California. Available at http://purl.stanford.edu/nw918rb0745. GIS Layer Number = 85/ Original mapping source was a small map of district. This was converted to an AutoCAD file, then plotted and reviewed by the County's Elections Department staff. These data were compiled from many different sources; therefore, the accuracy of the individual layers varies significantly, and some layers do not align exactly with others. In the urban areas, data are generally accurate within five to ten feet of their true geographic coordinates, but in the rural areas, data may be accurate to only within three hundred feet. With these limitations, the County of Santa Cruz disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy or correctness of this data. This disclaimer is exclusive and in lieu of any warranties, fitness for particular purpose, and/or any other type of warranty, whether expressed or implied. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
