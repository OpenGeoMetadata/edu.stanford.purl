There are three designation categories: nonattainment, unclassifiable and attainment areas. Non-attainment areas are those which are in violation of the standard. This data layer is current as of November 2003. Projection: Teale Albers, NAD83. This shapefile can be used to identify designation areas that are defined pursuant to the corresponding federal national ambient air quality standard for each pollutant as per the Clean Air Act.
