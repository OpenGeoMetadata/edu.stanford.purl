Attributes give specific information on each of the marine protected areas that have associated DFG fishing regulations for 2004. Information includes: the current names of the existing MPAs, proposed names (pending 2004 Commission approval), current MPA designation, proposed MPA designation (without regulation changes), county which has jurisdiction over each MPA, source and reference information. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Department of Fish and Game.This layer's intended use is to depict California's marine protected areas with associated Department of Fish and Game fishing regulations of 2004.",
