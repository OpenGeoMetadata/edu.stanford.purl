  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile depicting bathymetric contour line at 5-meter intervals was created out to the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) boundary on the California coast. This file was interpolated from a 200m Teale bathymetric grid with ESRI Spatial Analyst 8.1 These data provide coverage for most of the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off the coast of California, identifying depth variations througout the EEZ. These data are not suitable for navigation purposes. California Department of Fish and Wildlife. (2000). 5-Meter Contours: California Coast, 2000. Marine Region GIS Lab. Available at:  http://purl.stanford.edu/pb497kd3664. Converted to California Teale Albers NAD 83 by the California Department of Fish and Game, Marine GIS This file draws slowly because of the number of contour lines. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
