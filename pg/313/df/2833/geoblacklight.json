  "dc_description_s": "5-year American Community Survey estimates of socioeconomic variables (see below) at the county level released in 2012. The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureaus Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four States (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their States. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities. The 2010 Census boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are as of January 1, 2010, primarily as reported through the Census Bureaus Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).The American Community Survey (ACS) 5 Year 2008-2012 socioeconomic information is a subset of information available for download. Downloaded tables include: B08013 - Aggregate Travel Time To Work Of Workers By Sex, B08303 - Travel Time To Work, B17019 - Poverty Status In The Past 12 Months Of Families By Household Type By Tenure, B17021 - Poverty Status Of Individuals In The Past 12 Months By Living Arrangement, B19001 - Household Income In The Past 12 Months, B19013 - Median Household Income In The Past 12 Months, B19025 - Aggregate Household Income In The Past 12 Months, B19113 - Median Family Income In The Past 12 Months, B19202 - Median Nonfamily Household Income In The Past 12 Months, B23001 - Sex By Age By Employment Status For The Population 16 Years And Over, B25014 - Tenure By Occupants Per Room, B25026 - Total Population in Occupied Housing Units by Tenure by year Householder Moved into Unit, B25106 - Tenure By Housing Costs As A Percentage Of Household Income In The Past 12 Months, C24010 - Sex By Occupation For The Civilian Employed Population 16 Years And Over, B20004 - Median Earnings In the Past 12 Months (In 2009 Inflation-Adjusted Dollars) by Sex by Educational Attainment for the Population 25 Years and Over, B23006 - Educational Attainment by Employment Status for the Population 25 to 64 Years and B24021 - Occupation By Median Earnings In The Past 12 Months (In 2012 Inflation-Adjusted Dollars) For The Full-Time, Year-Round Civilian Employed Population 16 Years And Over. Data is current as of 5/6/2015. This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)
