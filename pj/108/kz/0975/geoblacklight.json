  "dc_description_s": "Stream inventory data was collected between 1994 and 2002 in tributaries to the Russian River Basin. Data was collected from approximately 180 streams comprising 750 miles (approximately 75% of the remaining steelhead habitat, and 100% percent of the known coho salmon habitat) in the basin. Following completion of a desktop watershed information assessment, the California Department of Fish and Game conducted in-field fish habitat inventories including: 1) stream channel typing; 2) habitat typing; and 3) biological surveys to describe fish habitat utilization and distribution of fish and other aquatic species basin-wide This dataset was collected to determine if critical habitat needs of a target species are lacking, and if there are areas where improvements can be made by habitat and channel typing, and biological information collected during spawning and juvenile rearing surveys. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). Salmonid Habitat Recommendations: Russian River Basin, California, 1994-2002. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/pj108kz0975 Crews that conducted the inventory were trained in standardized habitat inventory methods and supervised by CDFG. The methodology utilized in the Russian River basin follows the procedures in the California Salmonid Stream Habitat Restoration Manual (Flosi et al. 1998). \n\nCDFG has established “benchmarks” to define target habitat objectives established for north coast salmonid bearing streams. These benchmarks were adapted from the California Salmonid Stream Habitat Restoration Manual (Flosi, et al. 1998), and the Oregon Watershed Assessment Manual (OWEB, date) by Robert Coey, Associate Fish Biologist, CDFG, May 2000. Recommendations were developed from a limiting factors analysis which determined the condition of each stream, relative to how close each variable met the benchmark criteria (CDFG 2002).\n\nRecommendations for fish habitat improvement are listed based on an analysis of the channel and habitat tying data, the biological inventory, and a review of the comments. The criteria for making and prioritizing each recommendation and treatment alternatives are documented in the California Salmonid Stream Habitat Restoration Manual (Flosi et al. 1998).Habitat restoration recommendations generally fall into the subsequent categories. 1 = Highest priority, 2 = 2nd highest priority, etc. (* = need has been identified from existing historical information or data, but no priority exists at this time.)
