  "dc_description_s": "Stream inventory data was collected between 1994 and 2002 in tributaries to the Russian River Basin. Data was collected from approximately 180 streams comprising 750 miles (approximately 75% of the remaining steelhead habitat, and 100% percent of the known coho salmon habitat) in the basin. Following completion of a desktop watershed information assessment, the California Department of Fish and Game conducted in-field fish habitat inventories including: 1) stream channel typing; 2) habitat typing; and 3) biological surveys to describe fish habitat utilization and distribution of fish and other aquatic species basin-wide This dataset was collected to determine if critical habitat needs of a target species are lacking, and if there are areas where improvements can be made by habitat and channel typing, and biological information collected during spawning and juvenile rearing surveys.",
