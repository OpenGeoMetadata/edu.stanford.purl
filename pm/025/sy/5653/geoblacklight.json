  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents the Amtrak thruway bus system in California. These buses operate in conjunction with the three Amtrak (Capitol Corridor, San Joaquin, and Pacific Surfliner) train routes in California. A passenger must travel on a train segment in order to use the feeder bus system. Bus routes follow major highways between stations however the actual route taken is at the driverâ€™s discretion and subject to change due to road conditions. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
