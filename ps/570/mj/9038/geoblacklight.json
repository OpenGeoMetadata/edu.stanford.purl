  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents the boundary of the Russian River Watershed in California. These data are derived from the California Watershed Map (v.2.2), a set of standardized watershed boundaries meeting standardized delineation criteria. The purpose of this file is to provide GIS users with a layer of the Russian River Watershed which is not divided into smaller, sub-hydrologic units.  This layer provides users with a layer that can be used to clip datasets that describe geographic regions larger than the area of the watershed. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002). Russian River Watershed Boundary, 1999-2002. Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/ps570mj9038 This dataset was developed through querying the Calwater 2.2 dataset for hydrolic unts that compose the Russian River watershed.  The resulting query describes the Russian River watershed and it’s sub-hydrologic units.  This file was then dissolved based on a common attribute field.  The dissolve geo-processing task was accomplished using ArcView 3.1’s Geoprocessing Wizard applications.  The resulting theme illustrates the spatial extent of the Russian River watershed. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
