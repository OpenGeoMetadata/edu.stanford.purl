The coverage includes the Russian River Basin in California. The bulk of the data are historical water flow records, however, there are additional observations on more than 40 parameters, including water and soil temperature, wind, dissolved oxygen, reservoir storage, etc. This layer can be used for watershed analysis and planning in the Russian River region of California.
