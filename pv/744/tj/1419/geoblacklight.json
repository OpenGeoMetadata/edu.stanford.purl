These data were obtained from information reported voluntarily to the USGS by the aggregate producing companies. The data represent commodities covered by the Minerals Information Team (MIT) of the U.S. Geological Survey, and the operations are those considered active in 2002 with production greater than 50,000 tons, which are non-government, non-portable, and surveyed by the MIT. This is a replacement for the January 2001 map layer. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition National Atlas of the United States. These data are intended for the geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be\ndisplayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey or the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data. National Atlas of the United States. (2005). Sand and Gravel Operations in the United States. National Atlas of the United States. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/pv744tj1419. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
