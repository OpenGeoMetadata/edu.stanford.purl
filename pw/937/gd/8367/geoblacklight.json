  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains mental health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) in California. The federal HPSA designation (formerly Health Manpower Shortage Areas) identifies areas as having a shortage of mental health providers on the basis of availability of psychiatrist and mental health professionals. To qualify for designation as a Mental HPSA, an area must be: 1. A rational service area for the delivery of mental health services, 2. A lack of access to care provided by Core Mental Health Professionals (CMHP) in the area, and 3. One of the following conditions prevails in the area: a. The population to CMHP ratio is &gt; 6,000:1, and the population to psychiatrist ratio is &gt; 20,000:1, OR b. The population to CMHP ratio is &gt; 9,000:1 OR c. The population to psychiatrist ratio is &gt; 30,000:1. Benefits of designation as a HPSA include: student loan repayment and personnel placement through the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) improved Medicare reimbursement enhanced federal grant eligibility. This is version 7 of this data (updated July 2014). This layer is part of the Healthcare Atlas of California. This data was developed by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development's (OSHPD) Healthcare Workforce and Community Development Division (HWCDD).  The data is used to support the following programatic areas:\n1) encourage demographically underrepresented groups to pursue healthcare careers\n2) identifies geographic areas of unmet need, and\n3) encourages primary care physicians and non-physician practitioners to provide healthcare in medically underserved areas in California.
