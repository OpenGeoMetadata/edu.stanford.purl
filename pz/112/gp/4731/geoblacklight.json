  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts catch basins and culverts within Monterey County, California. The source data for this layer is the \"Monterey Regional Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan\" by the Resource Management Agency Department of Public Works. The locations of the point data originate from the maps and spreadsheets in this report. A note of caution: the locations described in the maps and spreadsheets were often ambiguous and contradictory. GPS locations in spreadsheets were in decimal degrees to two decimal places and this was inadequate to give reasonably precise locations and points on maps were often different from those described in spreadsheet. Extensive field-checking would be necessary to make this data reliable. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Monterey County in California.This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
