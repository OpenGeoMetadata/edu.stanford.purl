  "dc_description_s": "This poygon shapefile portrays the distributions of United States and Canadian bat species during the past 100-150 years (1830-2009). The specimen and capture data were obtained from a variety of data sources, including U.S. State natural heritage programs, Canadian conservation data centres, published literature, unpublished reports, museum collections, and personal communications from university, federal, State and local biologists. Records are all specimen, roost, capture, or positive visual identification-based; no acoustic-only identifications were used for this map layer. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States.These data are intended for general prediction of possible presence of the species within a broad geographic area. Actual presence of the species can only be accurately known by actual field surveys conducted in a variety of seasons. No responsibility is assumed by Bat Conservation International or the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.",
