Includes transmission lines, substations, as well as power stations. The grid lines are sourced from OSM, and have not been thoroughly verified for accuracy. This other data is based on a digitized PDF map, and so is intended as a schematic of rough locations of the power network. It is not suitable for applications requiring high accuracy. The World Bank and the International Finance Corporation, collectively the World Bank Group (WBG) strives to enhance public access to and use of data that can support development impact.",
