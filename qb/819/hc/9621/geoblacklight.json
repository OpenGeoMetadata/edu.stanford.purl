  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts the boundaries for State Assembly Districts 29 and 30 for the County of Santa Cruz, California. Portions of Districts 27 and 28 also reside in Santa Cruz County.The California State Assembly is the lower house of the California State Legislature. Assembly District boundaries are redrawn every ten years based on data from the United States Census. Current Assembly District boundaries were drawn in 2011 by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission and took effect with the 2012 election. Due to the state's large population and relatively small legislature, the Assembly has the largest population per representative ration.

Available at http://purl.stanford.edu/qb819hc9621. GIS Layer Number = 27/ Boundaries were first converted from 1\"=1 mile Elections Department's Assembly District maps to AutoCAD drawing files. These were plotted and reviewed by the County's Elections Department staff. These data were compiled from many different sources; therefore, the accuracy of the individual layers varies significantly, and some layers do not align exactly with others. In the urban areas, data are generally accurate within five to ten feet of their true geographic coordinates, but in the rural areas, data may be accurate to only within three hundred feet. With these limitations, the County of Santa Cruz disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy or correctness of this data.
