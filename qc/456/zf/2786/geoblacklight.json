The term \"Unit of General Local Government\" means a city, county, town, parish, village, or other general-purpose political subdivision of a State. UGLGs are comprised of several Census geographies, summary level 050 (State-County), summary level 060 (County Subdivision), summary level 070 (State-County-County Subdivision-Place/Remainder), summary level 160 (Place), summary level 170 (State-Consolidate City) and the remainder of county boundaries.

Data is current as of Fiscal Year 2016, Census LED: 2013This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)",
