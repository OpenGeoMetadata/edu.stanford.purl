Each bay is described with a point location and name. GNIS is compiled mainly from USGS map products such as the 7.5' 1:24,000 quads. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Department of Fish &amp; Game.These data are intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.",
