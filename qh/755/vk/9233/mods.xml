  <abstract displayLabel="Abstract" lang="eng">This point shapefile contains data from the U.S. Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) about coastal bays and harbor sites in California. Each bay is described with a point location and name. GNIS is compiled mainly from USGS map products such as the 7.5' 1:24,000 quads. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Department of Fish &amp;amp; Game.</abstract>
  <abstract displayLabel="Purpose" lang="eng">These data are intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.</abstract>

This shapefile and attached metadata is a subset of geonames.shp. Converted to California Teale Albers NAD83 by the California Department of Fish and Game --BEGIN ORIGINAL METADATA FOR GEONAMES - THIS INFORMATION MAY NOT BE CURRENT-- LIBRARY : COUNTY LAYER NAME : GEONAMES COVERAGE NAME : GEONAMEA COVERAGE DESCRIPTION: The 'GEONAMES' layer contains the locations and names of features of interest in California. The source of this point coverage is the U.S. Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) datafiles. These files are compiled mainly from USGS map products such as the 7.5' 1:24,000 quads. There are numerous feature types in the coverage. These feature types are not exhaustive. For example, reselecting schools will not give you every California school, but it will return a large number of school locations. The features presented are the same ones present on USGS topographic quad sheets. VITAL STATISTICS: Datum: NAD 27 Projection: Albers Units: Meters 1st Std.

The following information is extracted from the Geographic Names Information System Data Users Guide 6, Department of the Interior, U.S Geological Survey, 1987. APPENDIX B.--Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) Feature Class Definitions The feature class terms and abbreviations currently consist of nine or fewer letters and were chosen for computer search and retrieval pur- poses. They do not necessarily represent terminology for the identifi- cation of all kinds of cultural and natural features. Although some of the terms may agree with dictionary definitions, they represent more generalized categories. Some commonly used generics are listed in paren- theses at the end of each entry to assist in understanding the range of cultural and natural entities represented by the term. Refer to the Reference Data Base to retrieve all generics thus far encountered in geographic names compilation. In most instances a plural form is listed as if it were singular; for example, archipelago or islands would be categorized as island. The terms and the definitions are as follows: airport - manmade facility maintained for the use of aircraft (airfield, airstrip, landing field, landing strip). arch - natural arch-like opening in a rock mass (bridge, natural bridge, sea arch). area - any one of several areally extensive natural features not included in other categories (badlands, barren, delta, fan, garden). arroyo - watercourse or channel through which water may occasionally flow (coulee, draw, gully, wash). bar - natural accumulation of sand, gravel, or alluvium forming an underwater or exposed embankment (ledge, reef, sandbar, shoal, spit). basin - natural depression or relatively low area enclosed by higher land (amphitheater, cirque, pit, sink). bay - indentation of a coastline or shoreline enclosing a part of a body of water; a body of water partly surrounded by land (arm, bight, cove, estuary, gulf, inlet, sound). beach - the sloping shore along a body of water that is washed by waves or tides and is usually covered by sand or gravel (coast, shore, strand). bench - area of relatively level land on the flank of an elevation such as a hill, ridge, or mountain where the slope of the land rises on one side and descends on the opposite side (level). bend - curve in the course of a stream and (or) the land within the curve; a curve in a linear body of water (bottom, loop, meander). bridge - manmade structure carrying a trail, road, or other trans- portation system across a body of water or depression (causeway, overpass, trestle). building - a manmade structure with walls and a roof for protection of people and (or) materials, but not including church, hospi- tal, or school. canal - manmade waterway used by watercraft or for drainage, irriga- tion, mining, or water power (ditch, lateral). cape - projection of land extending into a body of water (lea, neck, peninsula, point). cave - natural underground passageway or chamber, or a hollowed out cavity in the side of a cliff (cavern, grotto). cemetery - a place or area for burying the dead (burial, burying ground, grave, memorial garden). channel - linear deep part of a body of water through which the main volume of water flows and is frequently used as a route for watercraft (passage, reach, strait, thoroughfare, through- fare). church - building used for religious worship (chapel, mosque, syna- gogue, tabernacle, temple). civil - a political division formed for administrative purposes (borough, county, municipio, parish, town, township). cliff - very steep or vertical slope (bluff, crag, head, headland, nose, palisades, precipice, promontory, rim, rimrock). crater - circular-shaped depression at the summit of a volcanic cone or one on the surface of the land caused by the impact of a meteorite; a manmade depression caused by an explosion (caldera, lua). crossing - a place where two or more routes of transportation form a junction or intersection (overpass, underpass). dam - water barrier or embankment built across the course of a stream or into a body of water to control and (or) impound the flow of water (breakwater, dike, jetty). falls - perpendicular or very steep fall of water in the course of a stream (cascade, cataract, waterfall). flat - relative level area within a region of greater relief (clearing, glade, playa). forest - bounded area of woods, forest, or grassland under the ad- ministration of a political agency (see woods) (national forest, national grasslands, State forest). gap - low point or opening between hills or mountains or in a ridge or mountain range (col, notch, pass, saddle, water gap, wind gap) geyser - eruptive spring from which hot water and (or) steam and in some cases mud are periodically thrown. glacier - body or stream of ice moving outward and downslope from an area of accumulation; an area of relatively permanent snow or ice on the top or side of a mountain or mountainous area (icefield, ice patch, snow patch). gut - relatively small coastal waterway connecting larger bodies of water or other waterways (creek, inlet, slough). harbor - sheltered area of water where ships or other watercraft can anchor or dock (hono, port, roads, roadstead). hospital - building where the sick or injured may receive medical or surgical attention (infirmary). island - area of dry or relatively dry land surrounded by water or low wetland (archipelago, atoll, cay, hammock, hummock, isla, isle, key, moku, rock). isthmus - narrow section of land in a body of water connecting two larger land areas. lake - natural body of inland water (backwater, lac, lagoon, laguna, pond, pool, resaca, waterhole). lava - formations resulting from the consolidation of molten rock on the surface of the Earth (kepula, lava flow). levee - natural or manmade embankment flanking a stream (bank, berm). locale - place at which there is or was human activity;
