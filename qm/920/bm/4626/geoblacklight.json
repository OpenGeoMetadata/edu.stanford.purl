  "dc_description_s": "This piont shapefile depicts centroid locations of 10 minute caltawl blocks. The source is the basic 10 minute grid which was created using the ARC/INFO generate fishnet command. The input coordinates were in decimal degrees and the resultant coverage was subsequently projected into Teale Albers. The coastline derived from the 1:100K hydrology was incorporated to the 10 minute grid. The trawl logbook developed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council, the States of Washington, Oregon, California and the National Marine Fisheries Service was used as the reference. Many grids are therefore 30 minute x 30 minute or larger or are partial representations of a 10 minute grid. Islands, bays, deltas and estuarine waters that occurred in the 1:100K hydrology were included in the coverage. Any features not in fishable waters were given an ID of zero. All other features correspond to the ID shown in the Trawl Logbook. The field containing the ID is called block10-id. This coverage can be used to support the following activities: Determining management needs (research, regulations, etc.). Project planning and management. Assessing effects of proposed projects or development on resources. Allocating personnel or patrol effort. Communicating resource information to third parties.

This extension was requested \"by Kevin Hill, MRD.\" 9/9/2002 Channel Islands showed a 100m shift from coastN27.shp. Channel Islands outlines were removed from blocks. Block polygons were then reclipped to correct Channel Island polygons. Farallon Islands show the same shift. They have not been corrected at this time. Corrections to come. 12/9/2002 Farallon Islands removed from blocks. Blocks were reclipped to corrected Faralon polygons to match CoastN27 polyline. --BEGIN ORIGINAL METADATA - THIS INFORMATION MAY NOT BE CURRENT-- DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME -- GIS METADATA DFG Trawl logbook catch grid COVERAGE NAME: caltrawl COVERAGE PATH: dfghost:/gdata2/gisuser/ioshima/dat/trawldata METADATA FILE: caltrawl.txt METADATA DATE: Feburary 26, 1996 LATEST NOTES: 2/26/96 The current coverage is being sent to DFG Biometrics in Menlo Park for assessment. 7/26/96 The current coverage has an error which causes it to be slightly offset.

The input coordinates were in decimal degrees and the resultant coverage was subsequently projected into Teale Albers. The coastline derived from the 1:100K hydrology was incorporated to the 10 minute grid. The trawl logbook developed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council, the States of Washington, Oregon, and California, and the National Marine Fisheries Service was used as the reference. Many grids; therefore, are 30' x 30' or larger or are partial representations of a 10' grid. Islands, bays, deltas and esturine waters that occurred in the 1:100K hydrology were included in the coverage. Any features not in fishable waters were given an ID of zero. All other features correspond to the ID shown in the \"Trawl Logbook\". The field containing the ID is called block10-id. Note: Only those blocks within California's boundries are contained in this coverage. All blocks with ID > 916 are islands or not valid trawl blocks.

NO COORDINATE SYSTEM DEFINED ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sample Trawl Data Year: 1992 Trawl data relates to the caltrawl coverage by block number. caltrawl.pat:Block10-id ---> caltrawl.dat:Block (ONE TO MANY) Each record in the caltrawl.dat file is a 'trawl event'. A 'trawl event' is the dropping and hauling in of a net. There may be many events per 'fishing trip'. Each 'trawl event' is given a \"drag_nbr\" in the table. This indicates the sequence of events. In general, if you group the vessel ID and Port for particular departure time and date, this would be a 'fishing trip'. This would likely show a number of 'trawl events' as indicated by the sequential \"drag_nbr\"'s. The table may be queried in many ways and related back to the caltrawl coverage to show which blocks satified the query(s). Whenever your end query has repeated block ids or ONE --> MANY you must choose to link the tables (ArcView / ARC-INFO). If your end query has non-repeating block ids, you can opt to join the resultant table back to the coverage. The advantage to ending up with a joined situation is that in ArcView the 'Theme' then can be easily classified. For instance, green shade for less harvesting and red for heavy harvesting etc....
