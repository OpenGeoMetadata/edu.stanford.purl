  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains crude oil rail terminals in the United States as of November 2014. These rail terminals support the loading and unloading of crude oil. This layer was created from publicly available data from a variety of sources with varying scales and levels of accuracy. These data are not visible if zoomed in beyond 1:1,000,000 scale. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data produced by the U.S. National Energy Information Administration.This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
