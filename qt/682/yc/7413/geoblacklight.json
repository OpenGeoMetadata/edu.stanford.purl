  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents coho salmon locations in California Dept. of Fish and Game records from biosampling and other surveys, plus other available records such as those of the Warm Springs Dam Hatchery and the Occidental Arts and Ecology Center. The underlying hydrology is the CDF-NCWAP 1:24,000 streams layer, which is derived from USGS 7.5-minute Digital Line Graph data. The line work should therefore match National Map Accuracy Standards for 1:24,000 scale data (90% of tested points in the original line work were within +/- 40 feet). This should represent a nearly complete inventory of streams where coho have been verified to be found since January of 1993, however this can be contrasted with the historical coho streams available in a seperate GIS layer. This dataset depicts which streams in the Russian River basin have recently supported coho salmon. Circuit Rider Productions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (2002).
