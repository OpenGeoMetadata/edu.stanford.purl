  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts mine locations in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California. This coverage defines the feature name for each mine and a unique, permanent feature identification number. This data was originally compiled by the California Resources Agencyâ€™s California Advisory Committee on Geographic Names. GNIS sources data from Federal, States, local government agencies and other authorized contributors. This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
