  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts administrative boundaries for cemetary districts in the County of Sacramento, California: Elk Grove-Cosumnes, Fair Oaks, Galt-Arno and Sylvan. The Cemetery Advisory Commission oversees administration of these Districts. The Commission is composed of a representative from each Supervisory District, a representative from each Cemetery District, a Veteran’s representative, a representative from the “Public at Large” and a representative from the Coroner’s Office who serves ex officio. Its three major projects to date are the Indigent Memorial, the recommendation to the Board of Supervisors of cemeteries which should be designated historic and providing a plaque to those sites, and the development of a comprehensive database of Sacramento County Cemeteries. This layer is part of a collection of data originally produced for Sacramento County, California.The Sacramento County Geographic Information Systems (GIS) unit falls under the purview of the Sacramento County Department of Technology and is tasked with initiating, integrating and promoting the use of GIS Technology in the support of County business goals and objectives. This coverage can be used for basic applications, such as viewing, querying and map output production, or to provide a base map to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
