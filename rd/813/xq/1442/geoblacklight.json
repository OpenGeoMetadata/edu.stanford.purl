  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts centroid locations of power plant entrainment in the Southern California Bight. Included in the attributes is the count of larvae entrained per year. This is the reference used to create this shapefile: Foster, M., Steinbeck, J. 2008. Compilation of California coastal power plant entrainment and impingement estimates for California State Water Resources Control Board staff draft issue paper on once-through cooling. California State Water Resources Control Board.This coverage displays the centroid locations of power plant entrainment in the Southern California Bight, the curved coastline of Southern California between Point Conception and San Diego. Entrainment is a process by which small aquatic organisms are carried by the cooling water into a power plant and assumed killed by heat, turbulence and/or chemicals.",
