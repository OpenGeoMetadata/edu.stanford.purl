  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents the railroad network of California. This layer contains all alignment for passenger and freight railroad lines, including commuter rail and heavy rail, segmented by milepost as listed in the California Regional Timetable 20. The Rail feature class allows for the selection of all passenger, commuter, recreational, freight, and shortline rail alignment in California with the exception of BART. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
