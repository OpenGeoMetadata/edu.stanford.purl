  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents areas of surface water in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve (JRBP), including Searsville Lake. The JRBP is located in Woodside, California near Stanford University's campus in the eastern foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The preserve encompasses remarkable geologic, topographic, and biotic diversity within its 485 hectares (1,198 acres) and provides a natural laboratory for researchers from all over the world, educational experiences to students and docent-led visitors, and refuge to native plants and animals.This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
