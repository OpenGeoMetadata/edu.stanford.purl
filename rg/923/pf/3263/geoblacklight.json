  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile shows the locations of government buildings (ministries, departments, the Supreme Court and the Presidential Palace) in Kabul, Afghanistan. This layer was mapped at 1:5,000 scale from the one meter IKONOS satellite imagery. This layer does not reveal the structure of the buildings but rather an estimated point location of the building. The accuracy of these data may vary from 15 meters to 30 meters. This layer is part of the Topographic Maps of Afghanistan and Kabul dataset which contains shapefiles relating to district and provincial boundaries, land use, transportation, buildings and structures, rivers, settlements and other specific city data.This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
