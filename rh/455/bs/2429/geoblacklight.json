  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains forty-one watersheds delineated within five river basins in Afghanistan, five of them are non-drainage areas. The size of the watersheds was limited in order to retain meso-units√¢ suitable for hydrological and agricultural/agro-meteorological monitoring and analysis and watershed management activities. Upper Hilmand is the largest watershed in Afghanistan, covering 46,882 sq. km, while the smallest watershed is Dasht-i Nawur, which covers 1,618 sq. km. Data at this scale is suitable for general studies and local planning.",
