The marine regions from this map picture were used as the basis for the 4 regions of the Marine Protected Areas excercise, conducted as part of compliance with AB 993 in 2001. They were digitized from this map scan since no GIS product existed. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Department of Fish and Game.This dataset can be used to identify the outline of California's ecological provinces and regions.",
