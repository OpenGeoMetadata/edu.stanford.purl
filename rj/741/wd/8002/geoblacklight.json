  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile was screen digitized from 'Calecoregions1.jpg' a georectified digital image of the original map of California's ecoregions, include the marine ecoregions, created by Jim Bailey of the California State Department of Parks and Recreation. The marine regions from this map picture were used as the basis for the 4 regions of the Marine Protected Areas excercise, conducted as part of compliance with AB 993 in 2001. They were digitized from this map scan since no GIS product existed. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Department of Fish and Game. This dataset can be used to identify the outline of California's ecological provinces and regions. California Department of Fish and Game. Marine Resources Region. (2000). Marine Ecological Regions, California, 2000. California Department of Fish and Game. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/rj741wd8002. There is no concensus amongst agencies or marine biologists that these ecoregions have defensible ecological boundaries. They may be considered convenient management areas. The marine ecoregion boundaries are not universally accepted as valid ecosystem units. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
