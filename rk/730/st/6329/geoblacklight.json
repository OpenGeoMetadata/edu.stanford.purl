  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents groundwater elevation in California for fall 2013. This layer shows the depth to groundwater values collected from wells. The measurement values may not exactly match the contour values because of the smoothing process. Depth information is represented in feet below the ground surface. Increasing values indicate increasing depth to groundwater (or deeper/lower water levels). Negative values indicate that the groundwater level is above ground surface. Water level measurements are selected based on measurement data and well construction information (where available) and approximate groundwater levels in the unconfined to uppermost semi-confined aquifers. This layer is intended to be used as a compliment to data, reports, and other information provided by the California Groundwater Information Center. California Department of Water Resources. (2016). Groundwater Elevation, California, Fall 2013. California Department of Water Resources. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/rk730st6329. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
