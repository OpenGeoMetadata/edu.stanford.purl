  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents liquefied natural gas import/export terminals in the United States. The data exclude the import facility in Puerto Rico. These data were gahtered from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and were last updated in September 2012. Terminals capable of liquefaction of natural gas for transport (Kenai, AK), or receipt and regasification of LNG for use as natural gas (GA - Elba Island; LA - Cameron, Lake Charles, Gulf Gateway Deepwater Port, and Sabine Pass; MA - Everett, Neptune, and Northeast Gateway Energy Bridge; MD - Cove Point; PR - Pe√±uelas; TX - Freeport and Golden Pass). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data produced by the U.S. National Energy Information Administration.This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
