These data were was mapped at 1:100,000 scale from the United States Defense Mapping Agency (USDMA) topo maps. Borders in the east and south east of Afghanistan were digitized from the Quarter Inch English Map at 1:254,440 scale. This layer is part of the Topographic Maps of Afghanistan and Kabul dataset which contains shapefiles relating to district and provincial boundaries, land use, transportation, buildings and structures, rivers, settlements and other specific city data. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.
