  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts the Storie Index, a soil rating based on soil properties that govern a soil's potential for cultivated agriculture in the County of Santa Clara, California. The Storie Index assesses the productivity of a soil from the following four characteristics: Factor A, degree of soil profile development; factor B, texture of the surface layer; factor C, slope; and factor X, manageable features, including drainage, microrelief, fertility, acidity, erosion, and salt content. A score ranging from 0 to 100 percent is determined for each factor, and the scores are then multiplied together to derive an index rating. For simplification, Storie Index ratings have been combined into six grade classes as follows: Grade 1 (excellent), 100 to 80; grade 2 (good), 79 to 60; grade 3 (fair), 59 to 40; grade 4 (poor), 39 to 20; grade 5 (very poor), 19 to 10; and grade 6 (nonagricultural), less than 10. These data were compiled from the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey in the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database. Santa Clara County is divided into two soil surveys; a western part (CA 641, last updated: Tabular: Version 3, Sept 18, 2014. Spatial: Version 2, Dec 13, 2013) and an eastern part (CA 646, last updated Tabular: Version 9, Sept 25, 2014, Spatial: Version 4, Sept 19, 2014). This dataset combines those two surveys into one, easier to use dataset that covers the entire county. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Santa Clara County, California.The Santa Clara County Planning Office is part of the Department of Planning and Development. Their primary function is to plan and regulate land use and development within the unincorporated portions of Santa Clara County. Other responsibilities include policy analysis, GIS services, research and technical assistance relating to land use, housing, environmental protection, historic preservation and demographics. The Geographic Information Services Department has taken on all those activities related to GIS data and GIS process and procedures that cross organizational boundaries. Santa Clara County encompasses 15 cities and approximately 1.7 million people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data. ",
