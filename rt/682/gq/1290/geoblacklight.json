  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains the legislative boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in California as of April 2014, provided by the Division of Transportation Planning, Office of Regional and Interagency Planning. With the exception of Tahoe Metropolitan Planning Organization (TMPO), all of the MPO boundaries follow county boundaries. Four of these MPOs are multi-county; the other 13 all have a metropolitan area confined to a single county.This MPO feature class was created primarily based on Census 2010 county lines, excluding the islands. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.
