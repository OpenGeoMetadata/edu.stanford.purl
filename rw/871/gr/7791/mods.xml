    <abstract lang="eng" displayLabel="Abstract">This polygon shapefile contains the boundaries of California Regional Transportation Planning Agencies (RTPA) as of February, 2014. These data were provided by the Division of Transportation Planning, Office of Regional and Interagency Planning.With the exception of Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA), all of the RTPA boundaries follow county boundaries, some RTPA are multi-county. This layer was created primarily based on 2010 Census county lines excluding the islands. TRPA is actually a bi-state agency created by the U.S. Congress and a compact between California and Nevada. Federal laws and California and Nevada statutes govern it. TRPA is composed of parts of two counties in California, El Dorado and Placer, and two counties in Nevada. The portions of two California counties outside the Tahoe basin are part of the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG). ). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).</abstract>
    <abstract lang="eng" displayLabel="Purpose">This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.</abstract>

    <note displayLabel="Supplemental information">Data sources: 2010_TIGER_County_Area_MFL and 2010_TIGER_Areawater
The coastlines, islands, and the Bay Area were selected from TIGER hydro data, the shapes of some bay and harbor areas are modified using Bing Maps Imagery background, such as San Francisco Bay Area, Dana Point Harbor, Long Beach Harbor, Mission Bay, and San Diego Bay.
