  "dc_description_s": "Revitalization Area eligibility was determined by comparing the block groups median household income and home ownership rate to the respective rates of the surrounding area. If the block group is located in a CBSA Metropolitan Area then the metro area was used. If the block group was non-metro then the state rates were used. Also included are several variables relating to REO and FHA activity in the block group including average REO sales price over the last 12 months, 90-day FHA defaults, 90-day FHA defaults in foreclosure, active FHA-insured single family loans, active REO properties, and a 2-year history of REO closings. Data for owner occupied housing units provided by 2010 Census SF1. Data for median household income and home onwership rate provided by American Community Survey 5-year (2007-2011). Data for HUD single family FHA loans and REO provided by the Single Family Data Warehouse as of 06/22/2015. This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)
