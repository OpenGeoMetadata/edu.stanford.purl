  "dc_description_s": "This Priority Landscape (PL) prioritizes lands where communities (people and associated infrastructure) are at risk from wildfire to direct efforts at reducing wildfire risk in these areas. Ranking: The ranking varies from 1 (least risk) to 5 (greatest risk). Housing density derived from FRAP's WUI layer is used to rank assets. Threat is determined using California Fire Hazard Severity Zones . Asset: The asset to be protected in this PL is communities, which are defined by housing densities. Less dense areas receive lower value and higher densities receive higher value. The classes of density are: 0 = No houses 1 = 0 - 0.05 housing unit per acre 2 = 0.051 - 0.200 housing unit per acre 3 = 0.201 - 1 housing unit per acre 4 = greater than 1 housing unit per acres Threat: The threat to the communities is Fire Hazard Severity, derived from CAL FIRE's Fire Hazard Severity Zones. The zone ranking is: 1 = moderate severity 3 = high severity 5 = very high severity Final Ranking: The ranked asset and ranked threat were combined to derive the final ranked priority landscape. The results were ranked from the lowest risk of 1 to the highest risk of 5. This dataset was developed in 2018 to support the California Assessment of Forest and Rangelands.
