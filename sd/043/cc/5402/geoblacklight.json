  "dc_description_s": "This raster layer is a georeferenced image of an historic regional map of Southern Africa, titled 'Neueste Karte von Sud Africa,' (Latest map of Africa). The original map was created by Carl Christian Franz Radefield in 1846, included in Meyer's Handatlas No. 93 (1860). The map contains insets of Eastern Cap Coast, District of George, Cape Peninsula and Cape Town. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map was scanned and georeferenced by the Stanford University Geospatial Center using a Transverse Mercator projection. This map is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Africa from the Oscar I. Norwich Collection at Stanford University.This historic paper map provides an historical perspective of the cultural and physical landscape during this time period. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography. As this map has been georeferenced, it also can be used as a background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.\n    ",
