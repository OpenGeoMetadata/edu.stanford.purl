  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile shows the standard 3 nautical mile California state water boundary. It was created by buffering the line file called county-coast.shp, a generalized CA state boundary. This polygon does not account for the addition area of state water created as a result of offshore rocks or mounts, see especially in the northern part of California. This file has been found to not appropriatly represent the 3 nautical mile boundary as rendered on NOAA nautical charts. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Department of Fish and Game. This layer can be used to show a 3 mile buffer of the California Coast. California Department of Fish and Game. Marine Resources Region. (2004). 3-Nautical Mile Coastal Boundary, California, 2001. California Department of Fish and Game. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/sg211gq3741. Converted to California Teale Albers NAD83 by the California Department of Fish and Game This line is to be use for approximations only and is not considered a legaly binding boundary. DO NOT USE this file for representation of California's jurisdiction of ocean waters. Not for navigation. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
