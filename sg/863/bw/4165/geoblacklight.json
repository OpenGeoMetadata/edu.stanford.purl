There are many attributes that describe each airport, for example, location ID (airport code), owner, elevation, congestion level, large certified air carrier enplanements, foreign enplanements, hub size, and tower type. This layer is part of the 2014 ESRI Data and Maps collection for ArcGIS 10.2.U.S. Airports provides the boundaries for thousands of airports and runways.",
