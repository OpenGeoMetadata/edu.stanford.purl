  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents paleoshorelines for the geologic and geomorphic map (see sheet 10, SIM 3225) of the Hueneme Canyon and surrounding vicinity in California. The offshore map area is characterized by two major physiographic features: (1) the nearshore continental shelf and upper slope; and (2) Hueneme Canyon and parts of three smaller, unnamed submarine canyons incised into the shelf southeast of Hueneme Canyon. The nearshore, shelf, and slope are underlain by recent sediments and characterized by active sediment transport. Shelf and slope morphology and evolution result from drainage incision into deltaic sediments of the Oxnard plain during sea-level lowstand, and subsequent sedimentation as sea level rose about 125 to 130 m over the last ~18,000 to 20,000 years (Lambeck and Chappell, 2001). Sea-level rise (controlled by both eustasy and tectonic land-level change) was apparently not steady during this period, leading to development of shorelines during periods of relative sea-level stability. These paleoshorelines, characterized by shoreline angles and adjacent submerged wave-cut platforms and risers (Kern, 1977), are commonly buried by shelf sediment. However, their original morphology is at least partly preserved on the outer shelf and upper slope on the east flank of Hueneme Canyon. The geologic map includes four wave-cut platforms and risers separated by shoreline angles at depths of approximately 65 m, 75 to 85 m, 95 to 100 m, and 120 to 125 m. The map was published in Scientific Investigations Map 3225. This layer is part of the USGS Data Series 781. In 2007, the California Ocean Protection Council initiated the California Seafloor Mapping Program (CSMP) to create a comprehensive seafloor map of high-resolution bathymetry, marine benthic habitats and geology within the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. CSMP has divided coastal California into 110 map blocks, each to be published individually as United States Geological Survey Open-File Reports (OFRs) or Scientific Investigations Maps (SIMs) at a scale of 1:24,000. Maps display seafloor morphology and character, identify potential marine benthic habitats and illustrate both the seafloor geology and shallow (to about 100 m) subsurface geology. Data layers for bathymetry, bathymetric contours, acoustic backscatter, seafloor character, potential benthic habitat and offshore geology were created for each map block, as well as regional-scale data layers for sediment thickness, depth to transition, transgressive contours, isopachs, predicted distributions of benthic macro-invertebrates and visual observations of benthic habitat from video cruises over the entire state. This coverage can be used to aid in assessments and mitigation of geologic hazards and to provide sufficient geologic information for land-use and land-management decisions both onshore and offshore.These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy  makers, and the general public. This information is not intended for navigational purposes.The data can be used with geographic information systems (GIS) software to display geologic and oceanographic information.
