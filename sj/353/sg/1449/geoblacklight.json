  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents the wildlife density in Kenya's rangelands for 1977-78. This data was used in Map 5.10 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being. International Livestock Research Institute. (2007). Wildlife Density in Rangelands of Kenya, 1977-1978. World Resources Institute. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/sj353sg1449 Species numbers were aggregated using a \"tropical livestock unit\" (TLU) (which is equivalent to an animal weight of 250 kilograms) to grid cells of 5x5 km and then averaged by square kilometer. The wildlife counts include 21 different large grazing animals that can be observed during low-altitude flights in Kenya. Note: A wildlife density nul should be interpreted as \"No observation of wildlife\". Please refer to DRSRS for updates. Data set is not for use in litigation.
