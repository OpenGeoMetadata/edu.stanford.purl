    <note displayLabel="Use limitation">The County of Inyo provides GIS data for your use "as is." The Information provided is from various sources and agencies. The maps/data provided herein are for illustration purposes only and are not suitable for site-specific decision making. Information found here should not be used for making financial or any other commitments. The County of Inyo provides this information with the understanding that it is not guaranteed to be accurate, correct or complete and conclusions drawn from such information are the responsibility of the user. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy, correctness and timeliness of materials presented anywhere within these pages, the County of Inyo assumes no responsibility for errors or omissions, even if the County of Inyo is advised of the possibility of such damage.The data may have a number of errors which may include but are not limited to the following types of errors:Spatial errors - The areas depicted by these maps/data are approximate, and are not necessarily accurate to surveying or engineering standards. X/Y coordinates may be in error by several hundred feet or more.Registration errors - GIS data layers may not overlay each other correctly. Attribute errors - Database information may be incorrect.Currency errors - GIS data layers, databases and documents may not be the most current available or may not depict the specified time. All data are subject to constant change. Data input lags real-world changes by varying periods of time.Completeness errors - Data may be missing or data may be included that does not belong.Projection distortion - All map projections introduce distortion by representing the irregular shape of the earth's surface on flat maps. This affects feature shapes and map distances. The County of Inyo GIS Department attempts to choose projections which minimize these distortions when viewing most County of Inyo maps.ALL DATA ARE PROVIDED AS IS, WITH ALL FAULTS.
