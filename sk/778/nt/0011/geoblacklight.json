  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile includes habitat improvement projects, research projects (surveys and studies of streams, roads, watersheds), education projects, and hatchery projects (including trapping, spawning, rearing and releasing salmonids). Projects were digitized as polygons when they took place over entire watersheds, in unspecified locations in lakes, or over upslope areas (vegetation management, various erosion stabilization projects). Projects for which the exact location of an instream project were not known were NOT digitized as polygons. Polygon features were created by heads-up digitizing. Locations were taken from representations of stream habitat restoration projects marked on maps included in the paper documentation of the projects. Approximately 12% of projects sites (455/3850) could not be placed at specific locations. This dataset is intended to be a comprehensive repository for anadromous stream restoration projects throughout California.

Circuit Rider Productions. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/sk778nt0011 The California Habitat Restoration Project Database (CHRPD), is a cooperative project involving the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. Initiated in 1999, the CHRPD captures and manages data about anadromous habitat restoration projects with an emphasis on detailed project cost data.\n\nDATA SOURCES\n· California Department of Fish and Game, Fishery Restoration Grants Program\n· Restoration projects from 1981 to the present.\n· Includes both completed and ongoing projects.\n· National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (in progress)\n· California Coastal Conservancy (in progress)\n· Data from other sources are being investigated.\" This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes.
