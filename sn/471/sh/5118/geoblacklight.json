These data originate from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Refinery Capacity Report, (EIA-820) Table 3, Capacity of Operable Petroleum Refineries by State. In addition to the sources listed, accuracy for the locations of facilities shown on the map was improved through the use of publicly available sites such as company websites and satellite images from public websites. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data produced by the U.S. National Energy Information Administration. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.
