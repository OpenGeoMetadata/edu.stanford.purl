  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile portrays major dams of the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The map layer was created by extracting dams 50 feet or more in height, or with a normal storage capacity of 5,000 acre-feet or more, or with a maximum storage capacity of 25,000 acre-feet or more, from the 79,777 dams in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers National Inventory of Dams. This is a replacement for the April 1994 map layer. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data. U.S. Geological Survey. (2006). Major Dams of the United States, 2002-2004. USGS. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/sn895dj5621. In the online National Atlas of the United States Map Maker, at scales smaller than 1:4,850,000 the data is thinned for display purposes. For scales between 1: 4,850,000 and 1:22,000,000, dams are only shown if they have a height of 500 feet or more, or a normal storage capacity of 50,000 acre-feet or more, or a maximum storage capacity of 250,000 acre-feet or more (1280 dams). At scales smaller than 1:22,000,000, dams are only shown if they have a height of 5000 feet or more, or a normal storage capacity of 500,000 acre-feet or more, or a maximum storage capacity of 2,500,000 acre-feet or more (290 dams). ; {\"gdaId\" : 6065730} This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
