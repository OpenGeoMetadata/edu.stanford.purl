  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image containing bathymetric data for the offshore area of Tomales Point, California. The bathymetric and shaded relief maps of the area were generated from data collected by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) , Fugro Pelagos and by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Mapping was completed between 2004 and 2010, using a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders, as well as 234-kHz and 468-kHz SEA SWATHPlus phase-differencing sidescan sonars. These mapping missions combined to collect bathymetry from about the 10-m isobath to beyond the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. NOTE: the horizontal datum of the bathymetry data (NAD83) differs from the horizontal datum of other layers in this data series (WGS84). Some bathymetry grids within this map were projected horizontally from WGS84 to NAD83 using ESRI tools to be more consistent with the vertical reference of the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). A map that shows these data is published in Open-File Report 2015-1088, \"California State Waters Map Series--Offshore of Tomales Point, California.\" This layer is part of USGS Data Series 781.In 2007, the California Ocean Protection Council initiated the California Seafloor Mapping Program (CSMP) to create a comprehensive seafloor map of high-resolution bathymetry, marine benthic habitats and geology within the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. CSMP has divided coastal California into 110 map blocks, each to be published individually as United States Geological Survey Open-File Reports (OFRs) or Scientific Investigations Maps (SIMs) at a scale of 1:24,000. Maps display seafloor morphology and character, identify potential marine benthic habitats and illustrate both the seafloor geology and shallow (to about 100 m) subsurface geology. Data layers for bathymetry, bathymetric contours, acoustic backscatter, seafloor character, potential benthic habitat and offshore geology were created for each map block, as well as regional-scale data layers for sediment thickness, depth to transition, transgressive contours, isopachs, predicted distributions of benthic macro-invertebrates and visual observations of benthic habitat from video cruises over the entire state. This coverage can be used to to aid in assessments and mitigation of geologic hazards in the coastal region and to provide sufficient geologic information for land-use and land-management decisions both onshore and offshore. These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy  makers, and the general public. This information is not intended for navigational purposes.",
