  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains the locations of safety roadside rest areas in California as of July 2015. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) provides safety roadside rest areas as a part of the State Highway System pursuant to Streets and Highways Code, Sections 218-226.5. Safety roadside rest areas provide opportunities for travelers to safely stop, stretch, take a nap, use the restroom, get water, check maps, place telephone calls, switch drivers, check vehicles and loads, and exercise pets. Rest areas reduce drowsy and distracted driving and provide a safe and convenient alternative to unsafe parking along the roadside. This layer provides detailed rest area information by integrating the information from the Asset Management Inventory (AMI) database owned by Right of Way with the Statewide Rest Areas List from Division of Maintenance. In some cases rest areas are closed temporarily for maintenance, the facility web links will help to check the current status of the rest areas. ). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
