  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains the locations of bridges on the California State Highway System as of April 2015. The dataset consists of bridge attributes collected for the purpose of reporting to Federal Highway Administration. The data was extracted from the California Structure Maintenance and Investigations (SMI) database. SMI performs bridge inspections in accordance with federal regulations on over 12,000 State Highway bridges and approxiamtely 12,200 bridges owned by local agencies. ). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.

Note: The dataset consists of bridge attributes collected for the purpose of reporting to Federal Highway Administration. This data was obtained on the date indicated by the file.  The data was extracted from the SM&I database and may have been in the process of being modified when it was extracted.  For official data attributes for each bridge, use the signed and stamped Bridge Inspection Reports stored in BIRIS (http://db2.dot.ca.gov:7777/forms/frmservlet?config=biris).\n\nReference: Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal of the Nation's Bridges (FHWA-PD-96-0001) Public data but have some limitations, such as for planning purpose only.
