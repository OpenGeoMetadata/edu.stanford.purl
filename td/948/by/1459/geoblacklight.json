The data was extracted from the California Structure Maintenance and Investigations (SMI) database. SMI performs bridge inspections in accordance with federal regulations on over 12,000 State Highway bridges and approxiamtely 12,200 bridges owned by local agencies. ). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
