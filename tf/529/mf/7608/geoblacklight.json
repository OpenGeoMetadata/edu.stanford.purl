  "dc_description_s": "This poygon shapefile depicts building footprints for all 28 library facilities in the County of Sacramento, California. A Building Footprint is the area of a building that falls directly beneath the building and shares the same perimeter as the building or the roofline, therefore indicating the location of a building or structure.
