  "dc_description_s": "The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) is a federal block grant distributed via formula to states and local governments. States and local governments use these grant funds to carry out housing, economic development, public services, and public improvement activities that serve low- and moderate-income people. The locations of CDBG activities are derived from addresses provided by HUD grantees from 1996 to present in HUDs Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS). Until recently, these addresses were not validated on point of entry. The prevalence of missing or incorrect address data means that HUD cannot guarantee the accuracy of these locations. However, due to recent improvements to IDIS, HUD expects the quality of activity locations to improve over time. All CDBG activities in the categories of acquisition, economic development, housing, public improvements, public services, and other summarized by Census tract. All tracts are included, except for those that have a Total Activity Count = 0 or the Total Activity Count is NULL. Data Current As Of: 05/11/2016This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)",
