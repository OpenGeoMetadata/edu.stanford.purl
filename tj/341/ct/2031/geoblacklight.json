  "dc_description_s": "This zip code layer was constructed by Nevada County GIS from voter registration rolls and Assessor Mailing Addresses. It is the best available data, but boundaries are not precise. Zip Codes 95712 (Chicago Park) and 95924 (Cedar Ridge) are for the US Post Office and PO boxes only. In Truckee, there is a 96160 Zip Code that is for PO Boxes only. This zip code is not included in this layer because the Truckee Post Office itself is zip 96161. Nevada County (Calif.).
