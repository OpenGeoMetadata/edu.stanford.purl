  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts boundaries for state mineral designation areas in the County of Santa Cruz, California. These Areas contain mineral deposits of regional or statewide significance, in this case construction aggregate: sand, gravel and crushed rock. Existing quarries producing these mineral commodities are identified. (State of California Department of Conservation Mining and Geology Board Annual Report 1986). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California. The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. The GIS Unit serves all County departments and external customers and provides data on land, features and people of Santa Cruz County. Santa Cruz County encompasses 4 cities and approximately 265,000 people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.

Available at http://purl.stanford.edu/tm071zv3160. GIS Layer Number = 56/ Original Mapping Source: California Dept of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology, Special Report 146 Part IV and State Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA) Designation Report No. 7. Map Used to Convert to GIS: Source Maps. New Information Acceptable for Updating Maps: Revision of State Mines and Geology Designation/Classification Maps. Parcel Specific Overiding Information: Not applicable. The boundaries were plotted and reviewed by the County's Environmental Planning staff. These data were compiled from many different sources; therefore, the accuracy of the individual layers varies significantly, and some layers do not align exactly with others. In the urban areas, data are generally accurate within five to ten feet of their true geographic coordinates, but in the rural areas, data may be accurate to only within three hundred feet. With these limitations, the County of Santa Cruz disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy or correctness of this data.
