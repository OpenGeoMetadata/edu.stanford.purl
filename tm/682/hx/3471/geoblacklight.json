  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents walls erected in the city of Paris, France, starting from the Roman Era until the 18th century (308-1970). This layer includes roman walls on the Île de la Cité, a medieval wall on the right bank, the Wall of Philippe Auguste, the Wall of Charles V, the Louis XIII Wall (also known as the 'yellow ditches wall'), and the Wall of the Farmers-General. The ALPAGE programme aims to provide collaborative tools for the Humanities and Social Sciences and for Information Communication Technology (ICT) allowing for the development of research about the Parisian urban area. This aim is achieved by means of a GIS that includes cadastral and historical layers. APUR and Alpage-Vasserot © ALPAGE: D. Gherdevich, A. Bethe, H. Noizet, N. Faucherre, Y. Brault, 2013.
