    <abstract lang="eng" displayLabel="Abstract">This polyline shapefile depicts centerlines for the Santa Clara and Llagas groundwater subbasins confinend boundary in the County of Santa Clara, California. These boundaries outline the portions of subbasins that contain confined aquifers. An aquifer that is bounded above and below by formations of distinctly lower permeability than that of the aquifer itself potentially resulting in the aquifer being confined under pressure greater than atmospheric pressure. If such a confined aquifer is tapped by a well, water will rise above the top of the aquifer and may even flow from the well onto the land surface. Water confined in this way is said to be under artesian pressure, and the aquifer is called an artesian aquifer.The Santa Clara Valley Water District manages an integrated water resources system that includes the supply of clean, safe water, flood protection and stewardship of streams on behalf of Santa Clara County's 1.8 million residents. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Santa Clara County, California.</abstract>
    <abstract lang="eng" displayLabel="Purpose">To delineate the confined-unconfined boundary of groundwater to determine where groundwater recharge occurs, as well as basic information necessary to manage and protect the quantity and quality of groundwater resources. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.</abstract>

    <note displayLabel="Supplemental information">California Department of Water Resources Bulleting 7 indicated that the delineation of confined (pressure zone)  and the recharge area (unconfined zone) in Santa Clara County were  primarily geologic, hydrogeologic, water level conditions, etc. (1). Geologic approach: The presences of blue clay as capping strata in a number of well logs were used as a criterion to delineate the pressure zone boundaries. (2). Hydrologic approach: The characteristics exhibited by unconfined and confined areas under different conditions of stress were utilized for differentiating between pressure and free groundwater bodies. (3.) A water level contour showing lines of equal change in groundwater elevation for the period of summer and fall 1949 indicated a positive changes in levels of confined groundwater and negative changes in the free groundwater zones.</note>
