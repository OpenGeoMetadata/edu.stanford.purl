  "dc_description_s": "The U.S. Census Bureau, Center for Economic Studies, annual Local Employment Dynamics (LED) database provides a summary of job and worker counts and shares by industry sector.  LED data is available at the Census Block geography and aggregated to Summary Level 070 (State + County + County Subdivision + Place/Remainder) geography where it is combined with the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) information to create the grantee areas.  The HOPWA program funds are distributed to states and cities by formula allocations and made available as part of the area's Consolidated Plan. Persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families may require housing that provides emergency, transitional, or long-term affordable solutions.  In addition, some projects are selected in national competitions to serve as service delivery models or operate in non-formula areas.  Grantees partner with nonprofit organizations and housing agencies to provide housing and support to beneficiaries. To learn more about the LED data, please visit the following website: http://lehd.ces.census.gov/ To learn more about the HOPWA program, please visit the following website: http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/comm_planning/aidshousing Data is current as: Fiscal Year 2016, Census LED: 2013This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)",
