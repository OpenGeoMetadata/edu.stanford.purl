This data is displayed in Map 2.6, Map 2.7, Map 2.8 and Map 2.9 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being. It is used to show data for eastern Kenya, for which poverty data for the location- and sub-location-level were not available. World Resources Institute. (2005).
