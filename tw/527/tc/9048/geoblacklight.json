  "dc_title_s": "Fire Rotation: San Francisco Bay Area, California, 2004",
  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset depicts fire rotation class intervals calculated from 1950-2003 fire history on land areas grouped into strata based on fire environment conditions for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California. These strata are defined by vegetation, climate, direct protection agency and elevation. The fire rotation interval is the expected number of years it would take, based on past fire rates, to burn an area equivalent to that of a given stratum. Fire rotation interval for a given stratum is calculated by dividing the mean annual number of acres burned into the total area of the stratum. Finally, fire rotation values are grouped into classes. The larger fire rotation values correspond to less frequent burning. In contrast the higher the rotation class value is, the more frequent fire is in that stratum. The source data was compiled by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service. This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.",
