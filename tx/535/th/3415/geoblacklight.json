  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts timber harvesting plans generated by the California Department of Forestry (CDF) and Fire Protectionâ€™s Northern Region Forest Practice GIS (FPGIS) for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California. All timber harvest plan data was compiled and merged into this one dataset. This data was helpful in developing the watershed integrity analysis and determining the extent of timber plans in the region. This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.
