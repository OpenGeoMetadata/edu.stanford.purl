  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains the locations of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) field offices. HUD is organized into 10 Regions where each Region is managed by a Regional Administrator, who also oversees the Regional Office. Each Field Office within a Region is managed by a Field Office Director, who reports to the Regional Administrator. There is at least one HUD Field Office in every State and a total of 10 Regional Offices. Staff who answer the main office telephone will be able to respond to or direct your calls to the appropriate person. Data Current As Of: July 1st 2014 This layer is intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)
