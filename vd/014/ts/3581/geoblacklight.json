  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts centroid locations for Fire Department Stations in the County of Humboldt, California. This coverage includes addresses and phone numbers. Not all Fire Station locations have been checked for accuracy. The Humboldt County Planning and Building Department is responsible for protecting the public health, safety and welfare via building permit review and inspections consistent with California model codes as well as planning and development review and approval consistent with the county's General Plan. This Department oversees the Advance Planning Division, which is responsible for the Humboldt County's Geographic Information System (GIS) that is utilized by other County Departments; many federal, state and local agencies; and the general public. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data. Humboldt County Planning and Building Department. (2015). Fire Stations: Humboldt County, California, 2015. Humboldt County Planning and Building Department. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/vd014ts3581. Original Data Scale: Unknown\n\nUpdates/History/Corrections: Based on information provided in two fire\nresponse capability surveys. The survey data was gathered over a\n15-month period in 2003 and 2004.\nThis data will continue to be refined over time as necessary.\n\nCurrent Edits:\nJanuary 3, 2006 - updated Fortuna Fire School Rd Station address and\nHydesville Station location and address - clewis.\n\nOct. 27, 2006 - updated some locations based on Parcels and NAIP Imagery.\nAdded EditorNane and LastUpdate attributes for edit tracking. The County of Humboldt makes no guarantee of the quality or completeness of this data. It has not been fully reviewed for accuracy and is intended to be used for planning purposes only. The department assumes no liability or responsibility in the use of this data. While every effort has been made to assure the accuracy of this information, it should be understood that it does not have the force and effect of law, rule, or regulation. In the event of any difference or error, the law will take precedence. The accuracy of map data varies from location to location in the county. While the GIS is useful for planning purposes, it should not be relied upon to determine property, zoning or general plan designation boundaries or be used in any way for project design. All GIS data should be verified before it is materially relied upon for property or project planning. In urban areas the GIS map data maybe inaccurate by as much as 50 feet in any direction. In rural areas the map data may be inaccurate by as much as 400 feet in any direction. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes.
