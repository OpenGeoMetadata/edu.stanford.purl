  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile portrays number of wildebeest observed in 1977-78 and 1994-96 in the Athi-Kapiti Plains, Kenya. Note: This data shows numbers of wildebeest observed during the wet season by low-altitude flights. The data was then aggregated to 5km grid cells by number observed. This data was used in Map 5.15 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being. International Livestock Research Institute. (2007). Wildebeest Observations: Athi-Kapiti Plains, Kenya, 1977-78 and 1994-96. ILRI. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/vd704zq1972 Note: A number of wildebeest nul should be interpreted as \"No observation of wildebeest\". Data set is not for use in litigation.
