  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts a watershed integrity cluster analysis at the CalWater 2.2.1 Planning Watershed (PWS) level performed by mapping factors representing some of the most significant watershed threats. Each of the individual watershed integrity factors was individually mapped and then combined in the watershed cluster analysis. This individual threat, cultivated, was created by taking CalWater watersheds at the planning unit level (most refined) and running zonal stats, part of spatial analyst. The CalWater PWS watershed was the zone dataset (pwsname as the zone field) and Post Fire Erosion Potential as the value raster. Ther result gives you the mean percent post fire erosion potential in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California at the watershed level in a table that you can join back to the CalWater GIS layer and then symbolize as a graduated color with the mean being the value field. This analysis was done by the Conservation Lands Network Fish and Riparian Focus Team. This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.
