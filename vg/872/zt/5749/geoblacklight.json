  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile portrays annual projected water balance by subdrainage area in Kenya for 2000 and 2010. The data was taken from the Kenya National Water Master Plan (1992) and joined by sub-basin. Land areas with negative water balances (where water supply is outstripped by demand) will require investment in water resource infrastructure to cover their needs. This data was used in Map 3.7 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being. World Resources Institute. (2007). Annual Projected Water Balance by Subdrainage Area in Kenya, 2000 and 2010. World Resources Institute. Data set is not for use in litigation. While efforts have been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the state of the art, WRI, cannot assume liability for any damages, or misrepresentations, caused by any inaccuracies in the data, or as a result of the data to be used on a particular system.
