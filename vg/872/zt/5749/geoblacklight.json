  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile portrays annual projected water balance by subdrainage area in Kenya for 2000 and 2010. The data was taken from the Kenya National Water Master Plan (1992) and joined by sub-basin. Land areas with negative water balances (where water supply is outstripped by demand) will require investment in water resource infrastructure to cover their needs.This data was used in Map 3.7 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being.",
