  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts boundaries of the Flood Control Zones in the County of Santa Clara, California over which the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) holds authority. The SCVWD manages an integrated water resources system that includes the supply of clean, safe water, flood protection and stewardship of streams on behalf of Santa Clara County's 1.8 million residents. Protecting homes, businesses and transportation networks from the devastating effects of floods is one of the main jobs of the SCVWD. Since the early 1980s, the SCVWD has invested more than a billion dollars in flood protection programs, including constructing major flood protection projects, and protected more than 93,000 properties in previously flood-prone areas. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Santa Clara County, California.To establish a basemap of the Flood Control Zones in the Santa Clara Valley Water District.This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.
