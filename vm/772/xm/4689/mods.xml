    <abstract lang="eng" displayLabel="Abstract">This polygon shapefile includes all of California's marine protected areas that do not have associated Department of Fish and Game fishing regulations of 2004. This dataset is comprised of state, national, and international marine protected areas in California. This dataset includes all Areas of Special Biological Significance (ASBS), Coastal Sanctuaries, University of California Natural Reserves, National Marine Sanctuaries, National Parks (includes National Monuments, National Recreationa Areas, National Research Natural Areas, National Seashores), and Biosphere Reserves. This dataset is not intended for navigational use or defining legal boundaries. This multiple polygon vector shapefile dataset includes all marine protected areas (without any associated fishing regulations) for California's coastline and Channel Islands. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Department of Fish and Game.</abstract>
    <abstract lang="eng" displayLabel="Purpose">This layer's intended use is to depict California's marine protected areas that do not have associated Department of Fish and Game fishing regulations of 2004.</abstract>
