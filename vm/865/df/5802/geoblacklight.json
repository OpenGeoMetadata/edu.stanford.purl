  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents the 12 nautical mile distance from the California coastline. It was created by buffering the county-coastline, which is a generalized coastline lacking detail such as rocks. The 12 nautical line is for display only and can not be used for navigation. It reflects 12 nm from a generalized land boundary, without rocks, and can not be used to calculate coastal area. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Deparmtent of Fish &amp;amp; Game. The 12 nautical mile line images spatial relationship to coastline.
