  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the seafloor character map of Hueneme Canyon and the surrounding vicinity in California. This raster-format seafloor-character map shows four substrate classes of the Hueneme Canyon and Vicinity map area. The substrate classes mapped in this area have been further divided into the following California Marine Life Protection Act depth zones and slope classes: Depth Zone 2 (intertidal to 30 m), Depth Zone 3 (30 to 100 m), Depth Zone 4 (100 to 200 m), Depth Zone 5 (greater than 200 m), Slope Class 1 (0 degrees-5 degrees), Slope Class 2 (5 degrees-30 degrees), Slope Class 3 (30 degrees-60 degrees), and Slope Class 4 (60 degrees-90 degrees). Depth Zone 1 (intertidal) is not present in this map area. The map is created using a supervised classification method described by Cochrane (2008). The map was published in Scientific Investigations Map 3225. This layer is part of the USGS Data Series 781. In 2007, the California Ocean Protection Council initiated the California Seafloor Mapping Program (CSMP) to create a comprehensive seafloor map of high-resolution bathymetry, marine benthic habitats and geology within the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. CSMP has divided coastal California into 110 map blocks, each to be published individually as United States Geological Survey Open-File Reports (OFRs) or Scientific Investigations Maps (SIMs) at a scale of 1:24,000. Maps display seafloor morphology and character, identify potential marine benthic habitats and illustrate both the seafloor geology and shallow (to about 100 m) subsurface geology. Data layers for bathymetry, bathymetric contours, acoustic backscatter, seafloor character, potential benthic habitat and offshore geology were created for each map block, as well as regional-scale data layers for sediment thickness, depth to transition, transgressive contours, isopachs, predicted distributions of benthic macro-invertebrates and visual observations of benthic habitat from video cruises over the entire state. These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy  makers, and the general public. This information is not intended for navigational purposes.The data can be used with geographic information systems (GIS) software to display geologic and oceanographic information. Additionally, this coverage can provide a geologic map for the public and geoscience community to aid in assessments and mitigation of geologic hazards in the coastal region and sufficient geologic information for land-use and land-management decisions both onshore and offshore. This information is not intended for navigational purposes. U.S. Geological Survey. (2013). Seafloor Character: Hueneme Canyon and Vicinity, California, 2007.
