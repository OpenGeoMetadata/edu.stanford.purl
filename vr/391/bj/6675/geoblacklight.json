  "dc_description_s": "This polyline shapefile depicts the location of Tsunami Run-Up Lines for the County of Humboldt, California. When a tsunami moves inland, the large amount of water that a tsunami pushes onto the shore above the regular sea level is called Run-Up; the maximum vertical height onshore above sea level reached by a tsunami. Run-Up is a more damaging force than the huge tsunami waves due to their surging inland.The Humboldt County Planning and Building Department is responsible for protecting the public health, safety and welfare via building permit review and inspections consistent with California model codes as well as planning and development review and approval consistent with the county's General Plan. This Department oversees the Advance Planning Division, which is responsible for the Humboldt County's Geographic Information System (GIS) that is utilized by other County Departments; many federal, state and local agencies; and the general public. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
