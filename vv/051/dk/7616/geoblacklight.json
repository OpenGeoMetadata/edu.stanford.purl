In Swaziland, an inkhundla (plural: tinkhundla) is an administrative subdivision smaller than a district but larger than an umphakatsi (or \"chiefdom\"). These are the level 2 administrative units for Swaziland. This layer is part of the Map Library dataset containing line and polygon boundaries for individual countries on the African continent. The Map Library is a project of the UK charity “The Map Maker Trust.\" It aims to make public domain mapping data more readily available for development in all kinds of fields, from health care to urban management, from de-mining to environmental protection.
