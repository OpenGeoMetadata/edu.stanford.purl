  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts boundares for Groundwater Subbasins in the County of Santa Clara, California. This includes distinctions between Califonia Department of Water Resources (DWR) groundwater subbasins (Santa Clara and Llagas), District groundwater areas (Santa Clara Plain, Coyote Valley and Llagas) and hydrographic units (Santa Clara Plain confined and recharge areas, Coyote Valley recharge area, Llagas confined and recharge areas and bedrock). A groundwater subbasin is a subdivision of a groundwater basin created by dividing the basin using geologic and hydrologic conditions or institutional boundaries.The Santa Clara and Llagas groundwater subbasin boundaries were extracted from DWR Bulletin 118 update 2003 GIS coverage. The Santa Clara Valley Water District manages an integrated water resources system that includes the supply of clean, safe water, flood protection and stewardship of streams on behalf of Santa Clara County's 1.8 million residents. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Santa Clara County, California. To identify portions of two groundwater basins as defined by the Califonia Department of Water Resources: the Santa Clara Valley (2-9) and the Hollister Valley Basins (3-3). This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data. Santa Clara County, California. Planning Office. (2015). Groundwater Subbasins: Santa Clara County, California, 2015. Santa Clara County, Calif. Planning Office. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/vv585xg9890. The groundwater subbasins within the Santa Calara County managed by the District are the Santa Clara Subbasin (2-9.02) and the Llagas Subbasin (3-3.01). Delineation of groundwater subbasins is useful for knowing the extent of aquifer materials where groundwater recharge occurs, as well as basic information necessary to manage and protect the quantity and quality of groundwater resources. The Santa Clara Valley Water District (District) continually works to improve its understanding of the groundwater basins and subbasins boundaries.
