  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile portrays the current routes used for conducting Breeding Bird Surveys in the lower 48 States. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States. The digital data sets are used to create electronic and hard copy maps of the breeding bird survey routes. The data can be used to conduct geographic analysis on national and large regional scales. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:100,000-scale data.
