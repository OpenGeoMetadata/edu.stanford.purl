  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile shows locations of built up areas (areas containing a concentration of buildings and other structures) in Mozambique. The Global Map Mozambique version 2 was developed to update Global Map Mozambique version 1 based on Global Map Specifications version 2.1. The Global Map Mozambique version 1.0 was developed from the shapefiles Map 1:250.000 and 1:50.000 developed 1996-1999.
