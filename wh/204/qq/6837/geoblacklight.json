Land boundaries and Pacific grouping boxes. Marine boundaries and marine indicator lines are deliberately omitted for the 110m scale. Data was derived from the United States Central Intelligence Agency's World Factbook boundary database. These data are represented at 1:10,000,000 scale. This layer is part of the Natural Earth Collection (v.2.0.0).Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10, 1:50 and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software.",
