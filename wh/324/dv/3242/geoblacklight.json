It was obtained from the Department of Fish and Game Marine Protected Areas layer and edited to attempt to correct the boundaries according to their legal descriptions. These data are intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.

The State Board does not guarantee the accuracy of the maps. Shapefile Description: The layer represents the State Water Quality Protection Areas formerly called Areas of Special Biological Significance. It was obtained from the Deapartment of Fish and Game Marine Protected Areas layer and edited to attempt to correct the boundaries according to their legal descriptions. GIS Data History The original data layer was obtained from the CA Department of Fish and Game: mpa = ArcInfo coverage mpa.shp = ArcView shapefile The Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that were digitized for CA Department of Fish and Game by Deborah McArdle, Cmpan List Administrator University of California Cooperative Extension Sea Grant 1997. The ASBS locations were selected from the marine protected areas as a starting point for correcting the asbs locations according to their legal descriptions. ArcView Shapefile of MPA boundaries obtained April 1998 from: Deborah McArdle, Cmpan List Administrator University of California Cooperative Extension Sea Grant 105 E Anapamu, #5 Santa Barbara, CA 93101 (805) 882-1889 damcardle@ucdavis.edu The Data was then edited by DFG GIS analyst Will Patterson at the CA Department of Fish and Game wpatters@dfg.ca.gov DATA REVISION BY SWRCB The State Water Quality Protection Areas (SWQPA) were revised by SWRCB staff 2003 using legal descriptions from the 1974-1975 designations as printed in the 1999 ASBS pamphlet. Some boundaries were corrected to account for the state 3 nm limit. VITAL STATISTICS: Datum: NAD 27 Projection: Albers Units: Meters 1st Std. Parallel: 34 00 00 (34.0 degrees N) 2nd Std.
