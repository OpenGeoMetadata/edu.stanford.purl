  <note displayLabel="Supplemental information">Converted to California Teale Albers NAD 83 by California Department of Fish and Game, Marine Region GIS --BEGIN ORIGINAL METADATA - THIS INFORMATION MAY NOT BE CURRENT-- LAYER NAME : State Water Quality Protection Areas shape file : swqpa_may2003.shp This layer is DRAFT DISCLAIMER: The GIS layer was developed by staff using best efforts based on ASBS legal descriptions. The State Board does not guarantee the accuracy of the maps. Shapefile Description: The layer represents the State Water Quality Protection Areas formerly called Areas of Special Biological Significance. It was obtained from the Deapartment of Fish and Game Marine Protected Areas layer and edited to attempt to correct the boundaries according to their legal descriptions. GIS Data History The original data layer was obtained from the CA Department of Fish and Game: mpa = ArcInfo coverage mpa.shp = ArcView shapefile The Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that were digitized for CA Department of Fish and Game by Deborah McArdle, Cmpan List Administrator University of California Cooperative Extension Sea Grant 1997. The ASBS locations were selected from the marine protected areas as a starting point for correcting the asbs locations according to their legal descriptions. ArcView Shapefile of MPA boundaries obtained April 1998 from: Deborah McArdle, Cmpan List Administrator University of California Cooperative Extension Sea Grant 105 E Anapamu, #5 Santa Barbara, CA 93101 (805) 882-1889 damcardle@ucdavis.edu The Data was then edited by DFG GIS analyst Will Patterson at the CA Department of Fish and Game wpatters@dfg.ca.gov DATA REVISION BY SWRCB The State Water Quality Protection Areas (SWQPA) were revised by SWRCB staff 2003 using legal descriptions from the 1974-1975 designations as printed in the 1999 ASBS pamphlet. Some boundaries were corrected to account for the state 3 nm limit. VITAL STATISTICS: Datum: NAD 27 Projection: Albers Units: Meters 1st Std. Parallel: 34 00 00 (34.0 degrees N) 2nd Std. Parallel: 40 30 00 (40.5 degrees N) Longitude of Origin : -120 00 00 (120.0 degrees W) Latitude of Origin: 00 00 00 (0.0 degrees) False Easting (X shift): 0 False Northing (Y shift): -4,000,000 Source: Original from Dept of Fish and Game marine protected areas layer, but updated using legal descriptions Source Scale: unspecified It is 1:24,000 for some areas, 1:250,000 for areas that follow bathemetry Capture Method: Captured using ArcView 3.3 and ArcGIS 8.3 Data Structure: Vector Data Updated: May 2003 SWRCB DATA DICTIONARY: swqpa_Num - Integer field - State Water Quality Protection Area Numbers swqpaname - Text field - State Water Quality Protection Area Names DATA Quality: The data is close to the scale of 1:24,000, but relies on bathemtry layers (nbath50) from NOAA charts in some places and a statewide 3nm buffer of coastal areas (using GIS layer coastn27) including some islands not on other coastal GIS layers. This includes Begg Rock, Richardson Rock and Wilson Rock.
