  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains the governorate boundaries of Egypt for 2006. Egypt is divided into 27 governorates for administrative purposes. Governorates are the top tier of the country's five-tier jurisdiction hierarchy. A governorate is administered by a governor, who is appointed by the President of Egypt and serves at the president's discretion. Most governorates have a population density of more than one thousand per km², while the three largest have a population density of less than two per km². These data are part of a collection of boundary data for Egypt published by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization And Statistics. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. Central Agency for Public Mobilization And Statistics. (2015) Governorate Boundaries, Egypt, 2006. CAPMAS. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/wh765mk1189.
