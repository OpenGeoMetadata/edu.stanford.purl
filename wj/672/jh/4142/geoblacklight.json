  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains state mineral classifications in County of Santa Cruz, California. The State Geologist classifies mineral lands solely on the basis of geologic factors. Existing land use, by statute, is not considered. Classification of an area as a Mineral Resource Zone-2 (MRZ-2) indicates the existence of a deposit that meets certain criteria for value and marketability. The Classification Report also describes other categories of Mineral Resource Zone: MRZ-1, 3 and 4. The first 2 of these catefories are used to indicate if an area contains no resources (MRZ-1) or contains potential but presently unproven resources (MRZ-3). Areas where it is not possible to assign any of these categories are classified MRZ-4 (State of California Department of Conservation Mining and Geology Board Annual Report 1986).The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. The GIS Unit serves all County departments and external customers and provides data on land, features and people of Santa Cruz County. Santa Cruz County encompasses 4 cities and approximately 265,000 people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
