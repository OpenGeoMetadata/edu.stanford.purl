  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset depicts the annual precipitation by averaging monthly precipitation within the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California in 2005. This data was primarily used in the climatic stratification of the annual grasslands for the vegetation dataset. It was also used to report climatic information in the Biodiversity Portfolio Reports in the Conservation Lands Network Explorer. This data comes from the PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University. This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project and contributed to the developement of the Conservation Lands Network.",
