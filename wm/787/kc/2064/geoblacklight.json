  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts the extent of area affected by the top twenty areas of stormwater discharge in the Southern California Bight. The original point data used to create these polygon features was summarized by Eric Steine (Southern California Coastal Water Research Project) in November 2008. Eric Steine used the following reference: Ackerman, D. and Schiff, K. 2003. Modeling storm water mass emissions to the Southern California Bight. Journal of Environmental Engineering 129 (4): 308-317. This coverage displays the extent of area around the location of the top twenty sites where storm water is discharged into the Southern California Bight, the curved coastline of Southern California between Point Conception and San Diego. California Department of Fish and Wildlife Marine Resources Region. (2009). Major Storm Water Discharge: Southern California, 2009. California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Marine Resources Region. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/wm787kc2064. --BEGIN ORIGINAL METADATA - THIS INFORMATION MAY NOT BE CURRENT-- Due to the number of storm water discharge sites in the South Coast Study Region, the Science Advisory Tram recommends the SCRSG focus on the largest stormwater sites by discharge volume per year. Without representing differences in pollutant loading, attention is given to the size of the runoff. These estimates of the relative extent of possible toxic impact is based on a study4 performed by Bay et al. (2003), which found that the toxicity zone in the stormwater plume from Ballona Creek had an alongshore affect of approximately one mile up coast and one mile down coast, with an offshore extent of close to 0.75 miles. Assuming similar loading of stormwaters, similar linear bottom slopes, and that the relative volume of stormwater plumes scales with the annual runoff volume, one can increase or decrease these Ballona-derived lengths by the cubic root of the volume ratio (as volume is related to length cubed). This provides a rough scale of the possible extent of stormwater impact for each of these major stormwater sites. Again, this is a simplified approach and a more detailed assessment should be developed for any specific site that may interact with nearby MPA's Processing Steps: 1. Create point feature class using data summarized by Eric Steine (Southern California Coastal Water Research Project). 2. Buffer the coastline of the south coast study region based on the offshore attribute of the stormwater discharge point. Clip the resulting buffer by half the along shore attribute value on each side of the point feature. 3. Clip the buffers to the shape of the MLPA South Coast Study Region boundary. --END ORIGINAL METADATA-- This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes.
