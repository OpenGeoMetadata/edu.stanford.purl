  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents households with unsatisified basic needs in home sanitation according to the 2011 Census of Uruguay. A particular household will have unsatisfied basic needs in sanitation if it meets at least one of the following conditions: a) does not have a bathroom; b) bathroom access is not for exclusive of the home or; c) the sanitary service is not a generic network. An index of unsatisfied basic needs (Necesidadas Basicas Insatisfechas) is used to measure poverty. NBI includes indicators such as access to clean water, quality of housing, crowding, education level and others. The census information was collected by the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica in Uruguay between September 1 and December 31 of 2011. The original questionnaire and other supporting documentation for this census is included with this download. These data are intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.",
