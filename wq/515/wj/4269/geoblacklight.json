  "dc_description_s": "This polyline shapefile depicts FMCSA Hazardous Material Routes that were developed using the 2004 First Edition Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER/Line) database files. The routes are described in the National Hazardous Material Route Registry (NMHRR). With the exception of 13 features that were not identified with the TIGER/Line shapefiles, Hazmat routes were created by extracting the TIGER/Line segments that corresponded to each individual route. Hazmat routes in the National Transporation Atlas Database (NTAD), are organized into 3 database files, hazmat.shp, hmroutes.dbf and hmstcnty.dbf. Each record in each database represents a unique TIGER/Line segment. These TIGER/Line segments are grouped into routes identified as character strings in the ROUTE_ID field in the hmroutes.dbf table. The route name appearing in the ROUTE_ID is assigned by FMCSA and is unique for each state. The hmstcnty.dbf table allows the user to select routes by state and county. A single shapefile, called hazmat.shp, represents geometry for all routes in the United States. This layer is part of the 2014 National Transportation Atlas Database. The National Transportation Atlas Databases 2014 (NTAD2014) is a set of nationwide geographic datasets of transportation facilities, transportation networks, associated infrastructure and other political and administrative entities. These datasets include spatial information for transportation modal networks and intermodal terminals, as well as the reÂ¬lated attribute information for these features. This data supports research, analysis, and decision-making across all transportation modes. It is most useful at the national level, but has major applications at regional, state and local scales throughout the transportation community. The data used to compile NTAD2014 was provided by our partners within the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and by other agencies throughout the United States Federal Government. These contributors are the actual data stewards and are ultimately responsible for the maintenance and accuracy of their data. The mission of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) is to improve truck and bus safety on our nation's highways. That includes reducing the number of transportation incidents that involve hazardous materials and could potentially harm the public and the environment. Developing programs to accomplish these goals and increase the safety of hazardous material transportation is the responsibility of the FMCSA Hazardous Materials (HM) Program. United States.
