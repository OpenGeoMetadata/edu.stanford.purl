  "dc_title_s": "Narrow Landslide Features (Lines): Albion River Watershed, California, 1983-2000",
  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile depicts narrow landslide features within the Albion River watershed region of Mendocino County, California. Narrow landslides are those that often occur as torrent tracks downstream of a debris slide source. This file does not include narrow features that are less than 150 feet in length (see \"Landslides: Albion River Watershed, California, 2004\" layer). All narrow landslide features in this are considered to be historically active (estimated to have moved within approximately the past 150 years). These data were mapped at a 1:24,000 scale.This mapping began as part of the North Coast Watershed Assessment Program (NCWAP) which was de-funded by the Legislature in June 2003, the work was subsequently completed in late 2003 and early 2004. The California Geological Survey (CGS) evaluated the geology, fluvial geomorphic characteristics, relative slope stability and geomorphic characteristics within the watershed, and compiled the digital geospatial data described in this document. This mapping and compilation is geared toward providing baseline geologic and geomorphic data to aid in responsible land management, as well as the development of watershed restoration projects, watershed management strategies, and watershed plans.",
