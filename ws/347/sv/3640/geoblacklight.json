  "dc_description_s": "This map illustrates UAV images-detected and field work survey damaged structures in the town of Tlayacapan located in Tlayacapan Municipality, Morelos State, Mexico. The analyzed area is located at 68 km north-west of the epicentral zone of the 19 September 2017 M7.1 earthquake. The Institute of Geography of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (IGG-UNAM) identified 189 damaged structures. The analysis was performed using a post-event UAV images acquired on 7 October 2017 and field work. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation of flood waters.
