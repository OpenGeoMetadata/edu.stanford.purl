  "dc_description_s": "On October 30, 2015 Governor Brown issued an emergency declaration requiring public agencies to identify areas of tree mortality that hold the greatest potential to result in wildfire and/or falling trees and threaten people and property in these areas. Once identified, these areas will be prioritized for removal of dead and dying trees that present a threat to public safety. Tier Two high hazard zones are defined by watersheds (HUC 12, average 24,000 acres) that have significant tree mortality as well as significant community and natural resource assets. Work at the Tier Two level addresses the immediate threat of falling trees and fire risk, and also supports broader forest health and landscape level fire planning issues. This service represents the latest official release of HHZ. It will be updated annually when a new version is released. As of June 2019, it represents HighHazardZones19_1.",
