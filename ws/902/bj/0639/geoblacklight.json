This coverage was derived using road centerlines, sidelines and parcel boundaries as maintained by the County Assessor. These data were used to inform road operations workload for which the Operations Division of the County of Santa Cruz Department of Public Works is responsible for maintaining. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California.The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. The GIS Unit serves all County departments and external customers and provides data on land, features and people of Santa Cruz County.
