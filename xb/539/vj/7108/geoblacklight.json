  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts landslide activity within the Freshwater Creek watershed in Humboldt County, California at 1:24,000 scale. To create these data, geomorphic features were mapped on stereo pair photographs and transferred to 7.5 minute quadrangle mylar overlays. These overlays were scanned and converted to vector coverages. This map contains a digital representation of the map Geologic and Geomorphic Features Related to Landsliding, OFR 99-10, and the map of Relative Landslide Potential, OFR 99-10a. The map of Landslide Potential With Geologic and Geomorphic Features is a digital representation of the map of Geologic and Geomorphic Features Related to Landsliding, OFR 99-10, combined with the map of Relative Landslide Potential, OFR 99-10a. This map set was created using an ArcInfo GIS database by compiling information from OFR 99-10 and OFR 99-10a. The data for the original mapping (OFR 99-10 and 99-10a) was compiled from multiple sources including published maps and reports, aerial photograph mapping, and reconnaissance geologic mapping.The maps/data are useful in preparation of Timber Harvesting Plans, and for use by land managers for identifying areas of potentially unstable ground. The maps/data serve as a guide to potential problem areas where more site-specific review is required.",
