  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts biotic resource areas in the County of Santa Cruz, California. Biotic resources are designated due to their rare or especially valuable nature or role in an ecosystem and can be easily disturbed or degraded by human activity. Biotic Resources are protected and preserved for their genetic, scientific and educational values. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California. The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. The GIS Unit serves all County departments and external customers and provides data on land, features and people of Santa Cruz County.
