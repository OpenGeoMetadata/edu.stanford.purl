  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents routes designated as scenic highways by the California State Highway System. The Department of Transportation (Caltrans) manages the State Scenic Highway Program, provides guidance, and assists local government agencies, community organizations, and citizens with the process to officially designate scenic highways. The State Scenic Highway System includes a list of highways that are either eligible for designation as scenic highways or have been officially designated. These highways are identified in Senate Bill 1467, Section 263 of the Streets and Highways Code.The Scenic Highway feature class has California's 66 scenic highway routes. Each line segment in this dataset is registered to the 2013 State Highway System and represents a designated Scenic Route. These routes have been digitized to reflect the geometry of the 2014 State Highway Network data. ). This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
