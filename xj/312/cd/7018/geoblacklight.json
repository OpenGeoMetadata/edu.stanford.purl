  "dc_description_s": "The California Seafloor Mapping Project (CSMP) is a collaborative, multi-institutional campaign creating the first comprehensive, high-resolution basemap of California's state waters (shoreline out to 3 nautical miles). Sponsored by the California Ocean Protection Council, State Coastal Conservancy, Department of Fish and Game, and several branches of the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), this statewide project is being conducted as a public/private partnership involving industry, resource management agencies and academia. The tiered mapping campaign involves the use of state-of-the-art sonar, LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and video mapping technologies; computer aided classification and visualization; expert geologic and habitat interpretations; and the creation of an online, publicly accessible data repository for the dissemination of CSMP products. Final products will include a folio series of multi-layer strip maps spanning Californiaâ€™s land/sea margin showing the seafloor and coastal geology rendered in unprecedented detail. System requirements: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software.",
