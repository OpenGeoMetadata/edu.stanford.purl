  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains traffic volume (also known as traffic counts) on California's state highway network created from 2010 Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) counts (excel spreadsheet) maintained by Caltrans, Division of Traffic Operations. Annual average daily traffic is the total volume for the year divided by 365 days. The traffic count year is from October 1st through September 30th. Very few locations in California are actually counted continuously. Traffic counting is generally performed by electronic counting instruments moved from location throughout the State in a program of continuous traffic count sampling. The resulting counts are adjusted to an estimate of annual average daily traffic by compensating for seasonal influence, weekly variation and other variables which may be present. Annual ADT is necessary for presenting a statewide picture of traffic flow, evaluating traffic trends, computing accident rates, planning and designing highways and other purposes. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. California Department of Transportation. (2014). Traffic Volume, California, 2010. California Department of Transportation. Available at http://purl.stanford.edu/xj725sf9761. The data list 2010 taffic volumes for all count locations on the California state highway system. Peak hours, peak month ADTs and annual ADTs are shown at each count location. Significant volume changes (breakpoints) in the traffic profile along each route are counted and identified by name and milepost value. In addition to the profile breakpoints, these files list county lines and well-known landmarks to aid in orientation. All traffic volume figures listed include traffic in both directions unless otherwise indicated.

Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
