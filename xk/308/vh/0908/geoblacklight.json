  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile portrays the spatial distribution of elephant numbers observed in Kenya from 1994 to 1996. Wildlife counts came from a rangeland census using low altitude flights. Animals are aggregated to squares of 5 kilometers by 5 kilometers.. This data was used in Map 6.2 in Nature's Benefits in Kenya: An Atlas of Ecosystems and Human Well-Being. International Livestock Research Institute. (2007). Elephant Distribution: Kenya, 1994-1996. ILRI. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/xk308vh0908 Wildlife counts come from a rangeland census using low-altitude flights in Kenya. Numbers of animals observed were aggregated to 5km grid cells. Note: A number of elephants nul should be interpreted as \"No observation of elephants\". Please refer to DRSRS for updates. Data set is not for use in litigation.
