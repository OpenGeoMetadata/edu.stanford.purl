Includes transmission lines, substations, as well as power stations. The grid lines are sourced from OSM, and have not been thoroughly verified for accuracy. This other data is based on a digitized PDF map, and so is intended as a schematic of rough locations of the power network. It is not suitable for applications requiring high accuracy.
