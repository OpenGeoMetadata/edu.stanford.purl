  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile shows the results of Fyke net monitoring of juvenile salmonid passage that was conducted to evaluate the potential effects of reclaimed water discharged to Santa Rosa Creek by the Santa Rosa Subregional Reclamation System. Three Russian River tributaries, including two target streams and one control (Maacama Creek), were monitored over five migration seasons (1990-1995). Fyke nets fished in upstream and downstream directions. Data collected includes information for steelhead, coho and chinook adults and juveniles. The study period included both normal and unusually dry rainfall seasons. Fyke netting is only effective during low to moderate stream flow periods so data should not be used as annual salmonid populations estimates. Fyke net monitoring of salmonid passage was conducted to evaluate the potential effects of reclaimed water discharged to Santa Rosa Creek by the Santa Rosa Subregional Reclamation System.",
