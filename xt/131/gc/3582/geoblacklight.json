  "dc_description_s": "The Texas Land Survey is used to describe land parcels within the state of Texas in a fashion similar to the Public Land Survey System. This data is current as of fall 2012. This layer can be used to identify townships and ranges within the Public Land Survey System. This dataset is intended to assist users in locating and analyzing United States oil and gas field data and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. Hart Energy Publishing. (2012). Texas Land Survey, Fall 2012. Hart Energy Publishing. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/xt131gc3582. All lands in the public domain are subject to subdivision by a rectangular system of surveys called the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), established and regulated by the Bureau of Land Management. The original public domain includes the land ceded to the Federal Government by the Thirteen Original States, supplemented with acquisitions from native Indians and foreign powers. It encompasses major portions of the land area of 30 western States. \nThis release is intended to replace all previous datasets. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
