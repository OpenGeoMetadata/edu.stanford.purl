  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains locations of Airports in Napa County, California. These data were creted from extracting features labeled as \"Airports\" from the U.S. Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) datafiles (1997). The GNIS data is an automated inventory of the names and locations of physical and cultural geographic features located throughout the United States. Additional websites were searched for other airports and airfields. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
