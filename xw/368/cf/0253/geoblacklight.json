  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced image of an historic continental map of Africa from 1840. Originally created by Victor Levasseur, this map depicts landscapes, fruit, foliage and animals, with descriptive text and statistical information on towns and islands. The map contains 3 insets of Alexandria, Cairo, and Algiers. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map was georeferenced by the Stanford University Geospatial Center using a Sinusoidal projection. This map is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Africa held at Stanford University Libraries.This historic paper map provides an historical perspective of the cultural and physical landscape during this time period. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography. As this map has been georeferenced, it also can be used as a background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.\n    ",
