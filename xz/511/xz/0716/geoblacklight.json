  "dc_description_s": "This map illustrates satellite-detected, potentially damaged structures in the town of Tlaquiltenango, Tlaquiltenango Municipality, Morelos State, Mexico. The analyzed area is located approximately 72 km west of the main shock epicenter of the 19 September 2017 M7.1 earthquake. UNITAR-UNOSAT identified 1,216 potentially affected structures within the town boundary. The analysis was performed using a post-event Pleiades satellite image acquired on 05 October 2017 and Bing as pre-event image. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation of flood waters.
