  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains selected streamflow gaging stations of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, in 2013. Gaging stations, or gages, measure the height (stage) and volume of flow at a point location on a water feature. Gages in this map layer were drawn from the National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus) Version 1 Stream Gage Events, NHDPlus Version 2 National Data - Gage Locations, and from the National Water Information System (NWIS) Web Interface. The gage positions were adjusted (snapped) using ArcGIS so that the gages were located directly on streams in the National Atlas map layer, 1:1,000,000-Scale Streams of the United States. The gages and streams also share attributes that link them together.This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.
