It is useful for identifying offshore rocks but it does not include all rocks within the 3 nautical mile boundary of California's state waters. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Deparmtent of Fish &amp; Game. These data are intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production.

Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/yc911kh0288. Converted to California Teale Albers Projection NAD 83 by the California Department of Fish & Game, Marine Region GIS While this layer includes good rock locations for names and identifications, it should be expanded to include all rocks within the California state waters. This file has also been titled \"cst_geo_rocks_201.shp\". This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
