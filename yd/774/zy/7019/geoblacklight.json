  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile identifies centroid locations of Instream Dams in the County of Santa Clara, California that are used to divert and/or pool water in streams as part of the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) Groundwater Recharge Program. The objective of the Groundwater Recharge Program is to sustain groundwater supplies through the effective operation and maintenance of District recharge facilities. These temporary or permanent dams are constructed within streambeds to impound water in the channels and increase recharge rates via percolation through stream banks. The SCVWD manages an integrated water resources system that includes the supply of clean, safe water, flood protection and stewardship of streams on behalf of Santa Clara County's 1.8 million residents. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Santa Clara County, California.To identify locations and descriptions of instream dams in the County of Santa Clara. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data. ",
