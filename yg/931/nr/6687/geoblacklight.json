  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile contains fault lines within the offshore area of Refugio Beach, California. This map area lies within the Western Transverse Ranges province, north of the southern California Borderland (Fisher and others, 2009). This province has undergone significant north-south compression since the Miocene, and recent global positioning system (GPS) data suggest north-south shortening of about 6 mm/yr (Larson and Webb, 1992). The active west-trending Pitas Point Fault (broad zone including back faults), Red Mountain Fault, and Rincon Creek Fault are some of the structures on which this shortening occurs (e.g., Jackson and Yeats, 1982; Sorlien and others, 2000; Fisher and others, 2009). This fault system, in aggregate, extends for about 100 km through the Ventura and Santa Barbara basins and represents an important earthquake hazard (e.g., Fisher and others, 2009). A map that show these data are published in Scientific Investigations Map 3319, \"California State Waters Map Series--Offshore of Refugio Beach, California.\" This layer is part of USGS Data Series 781.In 2007, the California Ocean Protection Council initiated the California Seafloor Mapping Program (CSMP) to create a comprehensive seafloor map of high-resolution bathymetry, marine benthic habitats and geology within the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. CSMP has divided coastal California into 110 map blocks, each to be published individually as United States Geological Survey Open-File Reports (OFRs) or Scientific Investigations Maps (SIMs) at a scale of 1:24,000. Maps display seafloor morphology and character, identify potential marine benthic habitats and illustrate both the seafloor geology and shallow (to about 100 m) subsurface geology. Data layers for bathymetry, bathymetric contours, acoustic backscatter, seafloor character, potential benthic habitat and offshore geology were created for each map block, as well as regional-scale data layers for sediment thickness, depth to transition, transgressive contours, isopachs, predicted distributions of benthic macro-invertebrates and visual observations of benthic habitat from video cruises over the entire state. This coverage can be used to to aid in assessments and mitigation of geologic hazards in the coastal region and to provide sufficient geologic information for land-use and land-management decisions both onshore and offshore. These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy  makers, and the general public. This information is not intended for navigational purposes.The data can be used with geographic information systems (GIS) software to display geologic and oceanographic information.",
