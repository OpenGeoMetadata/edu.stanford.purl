  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains areas of visual sensitivity (visual absorption capability) in Monterey County, California. Areas with high sensitivity are unable to sustain new development without losing quality. Sensitivity areas are determined through visual impact assessments of visitor traffic analysis and how it impacts the surrounding landscape. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data for Monterey County in California. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.
