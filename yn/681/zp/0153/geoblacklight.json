  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of an historic paper map of Southern Africa from 1892. The original map was included in Rand, McNally and Company's Indexed Atlas of the World and covers the modern day countries of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, along with parts of adjacent Mozambique, Namibia, and Botswana. The original map identifies cities and towns, rivers, mountains and other topographical features, as well as historic sites, such as the diamond fields of Griqualand West. This map is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Africa from the Oscar I. Norwich Collection at Stanford University.This historic paper map provides an historical perspective of the cultural and physical landscape during this time period. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography. As this map has been georeferenced, it also can be used as a background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.",
