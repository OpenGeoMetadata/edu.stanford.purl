  "dc_description_s": "This polygon dataset represents the Public Land Survey System data at the township level. This layer is from the summer quarter update of 2014. This layer can be used to identify townships and ranges within the Public Land Survey System. This dataset is intended to assist users in locating and analyzing United States oil and gas field data and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. Hart Energy Publishing. (2014). Public Lands Survey System, Townships and Ranges in the United States, Summer 2014. Hart Energy Publishing. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/yq266hf1142. All lands in the public domain are subject to subdivision by a rectangular system of surveys called the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), established and regulated by the Bureau of Land Management. The original public domain includes the land ceded to the Federal Government by the Thirteen Original States, supplemented with acquisitions from native Indians and foreign powers. It encompasses major portions of the land area of 30 western States. \nThis release is intended to replace all previous datasets. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
