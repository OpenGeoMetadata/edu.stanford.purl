  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset depicts the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Fire Resource and Assessment Program's (FRAP) best estimate of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in a post-wildfire environment utilized in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California. FRAP adapted RUSLE, used for agricultural soil loss, for wildland post-fire erosion based on the interaction of fire threat and vegetation cover. The resulting soil loss estimates are grouped into three erosion classes: Low, Moderate and High. Source data was compiled by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. This dataset was developed/compiled for use in the San Francisco Bay Area Upland Habitat Goals Project, a Project used to identify a Conservation Lands Network (CLN) for biodiversity preservation to inform conservation investments and lasting cooperative conservation partnerships. The Conservation Lands Network GIS Database is the primary output of the Project. The data depicts the spatially explicit CLN that is recommended for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area Region, California.
