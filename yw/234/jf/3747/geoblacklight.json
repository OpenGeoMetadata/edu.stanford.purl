  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile depicts the political boundaries of North America, including: international boundaries, provincial boundaries, state or territory boundaries, and the International Date Line. This layer is the result of a joint venture involving the National Atlas programs in Canada (Natural Resources Canada), Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática), and the United States (U.S. Geological Survey), as well as the North American Commission for Environmental Co-operation. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States. The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national and continental level. These data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática, or the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data. U.S. Geological Survey, Canada Centre for Remote Sensing and Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informática (Mexico). (2004). Political Boundary Lines, North America, 2004. USGS, Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/yw234jf3747 The Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) is an international organization created by Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC). The CEC was established to address regional environmental concerns, help prevent potential trade and environmental conflicts, and to promote the effective enforcement of environmental law. The Agreement complements the environmental provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Further information on the CEC is available from http://www.cec.org/ or from &gt;Commission for Environmental Cooperation &gt;393, rue St-Jacques Ouest &gt;Bureau 200 &gt;Montréal (Québec) &gt;H2Y 1N9 Canada &gt; &gt;Telephone: 514 350 4300 &gt;Facsimile: 514 350 4314 &gt;Electronic mail: info@ccemtl.org &gt; All North American Atlas data sets are available in four data formats: Arc/INFO Export format (e00), ArcView Shapefile, Geography Markup Language (GML) and Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS). Although these data are distributed in geographic coordinates, the North American Atlas Map uses a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection. The following parameters were used for the map: &gt;Longitude_of_Projection_Center: -100.00 &gt;Latitude_of_Projection_Center: 45.00 &gt;False_Easting (metres): 0.0 &gt;False_Northing (metres): 0.0 &gt;Semi-major_Axis: 6370997.0 &gt;Denominator_of_Flattening_Ratio: 1.0 &gt;Ellipsoid_Name: Sphere &gt;Units: metres &gt; State boundaries in Mexico are included for illustration purposes. They were obtained from diverse sources and INEGI does not guarantee and takes no responsibility for their legal validity and/or accuracy. ; {\"gdaId\" : 6065780} All data for Canada and other areas outside of Mexico and the United States of America are covered by the Geogratis User Agreement for Digital Data. No use constraints are applied to data for Mexico and the United States of America. Acknowledgment of the North American Atlas, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática, Natural Resources Canada, and (or) the U.S. Geological Survey would be appreciated in products derived from these data.",
