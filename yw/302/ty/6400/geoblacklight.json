  "dc_description_s": "This raster layer is a100-meter resolution land and water mask in (GeoTIFF format) of the conterminous Alaska, with separate values for oceans and for land areas of the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Bahamas, and Cuba. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States. This 100-meter resolution mask image is not intended to be shown as a map layer. Instead, it is a cartographic tool that may be used to identify, select, and adjust areas on other 100-meter resolution image data sets distributed by the National Atlas of the United States. U.S. Geological Survey. (2013). 100-Meter Resolution Land/Water Mask of Alaska, 2013. National Atlas of the United States. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/yw302ty6400. The following pixel values are used in this map layer: >100 Ocean >200 Land ? United States >210 Land ? Canada >240 Land ? Russia Included with the GeoTIFF are an auxiliary information file (.aux.xml), an image overview file (.ovr), a value attribute database file (.vat.dbf), a .tfw file (more information included below), and a .prj file (more information included below.) The contents of the associated world file (.tfw) are: >100.0 >0.0 >0.0 >-100.0 >-3326950.0 >2437950.0 The projection (.prj) file contains the following information: > PROJCS[\"Albers_NAD83_Alaska\", >GEOGCS[\"GCS_North_American_1983\", >DATUM[\"D_North_American_1983\", >SPHEROID[\"GRS_1980\",6378137.0,298.257222101]], >PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0.0], >UNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]], >PROJECTION[\"Albers\"], >PARAMETER[\"False_Easting\",0.0], >PARAMETER[\"False_Northing\",0.0], >PARAMETER[\"Central_Meridian\",-154.0], >PARAMETER[\"Standard_Parallel_1\",55.0], >PARAMETER[\"Standard_Parallel_2\",65.0], >PARAMETER[\"Latitude_Of_Origin\",50.0], >UNIT[\"Meter\",1.0]] Data set extent in meters (Albers Equal-Area Conic projection) >North 2438000 >West -3327000 >East 1654000 >South 346000 There are no NULL or NODATA values in the GeoTIFF.
