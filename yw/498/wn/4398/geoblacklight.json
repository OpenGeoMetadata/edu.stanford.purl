  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents boat launching ramps in the northeastern United States. Boat launches are state, municipal, local, or privately owned sites that provide boating access to coastal waters, lakes, ponds, and rivers. Sites may be ramps suitable for trailered or carried-in boats, or landing facilities. Locations only suitable for shoreline fishing access and not boat put-in were not included in this dataset. This dataset is comprised of individual datasets provided by various sources in the northeastern U.S. Boat launch specific data was extracted from the source data, duplicate records were removed based on point location accuracy and data acquisition date, and datasets were merged into a single regional product. Points outside a 10km coastal buffer were eliminated. Based on source data, this product may not indicate private or public access for a given launch site and users are advised to determine accessibility prior to using a site. To support coastal and ocean planning and other activities pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act, Energy Policy Act, Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Rivers and Harbors Act and the Submerged Lands Act.
