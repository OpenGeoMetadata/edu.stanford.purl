  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts the 5 mile areas surrounding the San Francisco International Airport in the County of San Mateo, California outside of which Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), or drones, can be flown without appropriate notification of and approval from the airport or control tower. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other government entities have issued regulations for flying UAS. Areas of exclusion include National Parks, Military Bases, and with notification restrictions within a 5 mile area of airports. This map shows areas where drones cannot be flown (over the Golden Gate National Recreation Area) as well as areas where UAS operators must notify an airport or control tower when flying within 5 nautical miles of an airport. The following are the most important regulations related to UAS operations: 1) Fly no higher than 400 feet and remain below any surrounding obstacles when possible; 2) Do not intentionally fly over unprotected persons or moving vehicles, and remain at least 25 feet away from individuals and vulnerable property; 3) Check and follow all local laws and ordinances before flying over private property; 4) Remain well clear of and do not interfere with manned aircraft operations, and you must see and avoid other aircraft and obstacles at all times; and 5) Contact the airport or control tower before flying within five miles of an airport.
