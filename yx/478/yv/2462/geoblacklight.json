  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts the boundary for County Service Area 9 in the County of Santa Cruz, California representing the Residential Lighting District. In unincorporated areas, basic services like water, sewer, police and fire protection are provided by the County. Because Counties often consist of large and diverse geographical areas, providing a consistent and adequate service level across all areas can be difficult. Residents of urban communities may want more services than those residing in rural areas. The County Service Area Law (Government Code §25210.1 et seq.) was created in the 1950’s to provide a means of providing expanded tailored service levels in areas where residents are willing to pay for the extra service. When a County Service Area exists, property owners will pay taxes and fees to the county service area instead of the county for the services provided. The County Service Area 9 boundary can be annexed/detached at the direction of the Santa Cruz County Public Works Department. Unlike other County Service Areas, annexations/detachments to this District do not have to be reviewed by Local Agency Formation Commission or State Board of Equalization unless the annexation/detachment bisects an existing Tax Code Area. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California. The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department.

This layer is aligned to Assessors Parcel Maintenance These data were compiled from many different sources; therefore, the accuracy of the individual layers varies significantly, and some layers do not align exactly with others. In the urban areas, data are generally accurate within five to ten feet of their true geographic coordinates, but in the rural areas, data may be accurate to only within three hundred feet.
