  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains the locations of commercial vehicle enforcement facilities (CVEF), also called weight stations, in California as of 2015. Highway pavement depends upon the weight and frequency of the traffic using the facility. Heavy trucks cause far greater impact on pavement and bridges compared to passenger cars. It is important to monitor overweight truck traffic in order to preserve and extend pavement life. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Division of Maintenance created this GIS layer by retrieving the CVEF information from the Asset Management Inventory (AMI) database owned by Right of Way. The data attributes include the location description and weight station classification. Based upon the weight station primary function, staffing needs, size, location, and physical configuration, five classification have been established: A, B, C, D, mini-sites. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.

Available at http://purl.stanford.edu/yx674gw3304. The inspection program enhances commercial vehicle and driver safety.
