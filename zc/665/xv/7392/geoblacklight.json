  "dc_description_s": "HydroSHEDS (Hydrological data and maps based on SHuttle Elevation Derivatives at multiple Scales) is a mapping product that provides hydrographic information for regional and global-scale applications in a consistent format. Derived from elevation data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), the application offers users a suite of geo-referenced data sets (vector and raster), including stream networks, watershed boundaries, drainage directions, and ancillary data layers such as flow accumulations, distances, and river topology information. Educational levels: Middle school, High school, Undergraduate lower division, Undergraduate upper division, Graduate or professional Users may apply HydroSHEDS for non-commercial purposes. Any modification of the original data by users must be noted. The authors of HydroSHEDS may request reprints of publications and copies of derived materials.
