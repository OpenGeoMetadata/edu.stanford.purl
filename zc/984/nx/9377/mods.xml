  <abstract displayLabel="Abstract" lang="eng">This polygon shapefile contains the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for streams in the County of Santa Cruz, California containing all jurisdictions within the County on one set of FIRM panels. Cross-section information is lettered or numbered sequentially along each flood source, and contain Water Surface Elevations (WSELs) that are consistent for the length of the flooding source. Where analyses overlap community boundaries and analyses do not agree, the analysis with the most recent effective date shall be used. The body of the FIRM shall comprise base map information and flood hazard information, including any special notes needed for clarification . In applicable communities, it shall also include areas designated as Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) units, where Federal flood insurance is unavailable. This layer is part of a collection of GIS data created for Santa Cruz County, California.</abstract>
  <abstract displayLabel="Purpose" lang="eng">The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit falls under the purview of the County of Santa Cruz Information Services Department. The GIS Unit serves all County departments and external customers and provides data on land, features and people of Santa Cruz County. Santa Cruz County encompasses 4 cities and approximately 265,000 people. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.</abstract>

The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which "... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards," Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS.

The hardcopy FIRM and DFIRM and the accompanying FISs are the official designation of SFHAs and Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) for the NFIP. For the purposes of the NFIP, changes to the flood risk information published by FEMA may only be performed by FEMA and through the mechanisms established in the NFIP regulations (44 CFR Parts 59-78). These digital data are produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FIRMs and generally match the hardcopy map exactly. However the hardcopy flood maps and flood profiles are the authoritative documents for the NFIP. Acknowledgement of FEMA would be appreciated in products derived from these data.

  <note displayLabel="Use limitation">These data were compiled from many different sources; therefore, the accuracy of the individual layers varies significantly, and some layers do not align exactly with others. In the urban areas, data are generally accurate within five to ten feet of their true geographic coordinates, but in the rural areas, data may be accurate to only within three hundred feet. With these limitations, the County of Santa Cruz disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy or correctness of this data.
