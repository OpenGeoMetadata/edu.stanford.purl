  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of a map of the United States originally created by Matthew Carey and engraved by William Barker. The original paper map was published in Carey's American Pocket Atlas (Lang and Ustick, 1796, 1st ed.), which includes 19 maps showing roads, rivers, and boundaries for the different states and territories of the U.S. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map was georeferenced by the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) at Stanford University. This map is part of a selection of georeferenced historic maps from the David Rumsey Map Collection at Stanford University.This map provides an historical perspective of the cultural and physical landscape during this time period. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography. As this map has been georeferenced, it also can be used as a background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.\n    ",
