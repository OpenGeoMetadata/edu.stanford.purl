This data layer is sourced from secondary government sources (Survey of India, Census of India, Election Commission, etc.) and includes data for 357 districts, 23 states and 7 union territories. This layer is part of the Historical Boundaries of India dataset showing decadal change in district boundaries of India since 1951. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for district-level demographic analysis within basic applications to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.",
