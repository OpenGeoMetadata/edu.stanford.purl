  "dc_description_s": "a standardized compilation of published marine boundaries from the NOAA Office of Coast Survey and the Minerals Management Service. Authoritative marine boundary data and information is available from the Agency of Responsibility, although often only at a regional-scale and in a number of differing and disparate formats. The NOAA Coastal Services Center, working in conjunction with the Agency of Responsibility through the FGDC Marine Boundary Working Group, has compiled and standardized several datasets to create a national-scale, standardized data set based on several OGC and FGDC standards. Such datasets help to alleviate the initial cost of data mining, collecting, and the processing necessary to utilize such datasets for a variety of uses. Not for use for scales greater than 1:25,000.The NOAA Coastal Services Center's Marine Jurisdiction dataset was created to assist in marine spatial planning and offshore alternative energy sitting. This is a composite dataset derived from a collection of authoritative marine boundary data provided by the DIO Minerals Management Service and the NOAA Office of Coast Survey.",
