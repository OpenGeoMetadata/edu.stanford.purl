  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of an historic paper map of Africa. This is a continental map of Africa originally created and published by John Tallis in 1880. The features illustrated on this map includes: rivers, lakes, and coastal islands. Five engraved vignettes are seen on this map, an Arab family of Algeria, Bosjeman Hottentots, a view of St. Helena, a Bedouin Arabs' encampment and Korranna Hottentots. The illustrations were drawn by J. Marchant and engraved by J.H. Kernot. The map was drawn and engraved by J. Rapkin. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map was scanned and georeferenced by the Stanford University Geospatial Center using a Sinusoidal projection. This map is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Africa from the Oscar I. Norwich Collection at Stanford University.This historic paper map provides an historical perspective of the cultural and physical landscape during this time period. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography. As this map has been georeferenced, it also can be used as a background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.\n    ",
