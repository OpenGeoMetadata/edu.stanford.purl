  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile identifies centroid reference point locations of designated recreational fishing areas for California Recreational Fishery Survey (CRFS). Gathered by Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) CRFS field supervisors for each region. Compiled during 2002-2006 CRFS field seasons. This coverage provides recreational fishing references for the California Recreational Fishery Survey (CRFS). It provides recreational fishing reference locations for CRFS field survey maps for angler interviews. Through stock assessments, scientists attempt to estimate the amount of species in a stock and the rate of mortality via harvest. These are known as reference points. If the available data is limited the results of the stock assessment may not provide all the desired reference points. California Department of Fish and Wildlife Marine Resources Region. (2006).
