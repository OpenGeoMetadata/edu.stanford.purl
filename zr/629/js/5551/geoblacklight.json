  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile contains primary health care professional shortage areas (HPSAs) in California. On January 26, 2004, the California Healthcare Workforce Policy Commission (Commission) formally adopted a means to create the PCSA map. The process for identifying PCSAs uses the rule base listed below. In March, 2015, the OSHPD staff presented the Commission with information suggesting an update to the map to include current data on (1) physicians, (2) poverty and (3) population. Percent below Poverty Level (100%) Value Range Weighted Score 5.0 or Less 0 5.1 - 10.0 1 10.1 - 15.0 2 15.1 - 20.0 3 20.1 - 25.0 4 25.1 or Greater 5 (maximum) Physician-to-Population Ratio Value Range Weighted Score Lower than 1:1,000 0 1:1,000 to 1:1,500 1 1:1,500 to 1:2,000 2 1:2,000 to 1:2,500 3 1:2,500 to 1:3,000 4 Higher than 1:3,000 5 (maximum) * Any MSSA with a score of 5 or greater is defined as a PCSA. PCSAs are used as a means to help the Commission rank applications based on the number of program graduates and training sites inside areas of unmet need. PCSAs are the only consistently applied rule base to defining shortages of physicians, as the other designations are applicant based and require prior knowledge that a shortage might exist. This data is aggregated by Medical Service Study Area (MSSA) to obtain a count of primary care physicians by MSSA. Primary Care Shortage Areas are updated Annually and are used in the Song-Brown Grant Program for Family Medicine, Family Nurse Practitioner-Physician Assistant and Primary Care Residency programs. This update to data for the PCSA was approved by the California Healthcare Workforce Policy Commission on March 4, 2015. This layer is part of the Healthcare Atlas of California. This data for Primary Care Shortage Area (PCSA) was developed by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development's (OSHPD) Healthcare Workforce Development Division (HWDD).  The data is used to support the following programatic areas:\n1) encourage demographically underrepresented groups to pursue healthcare careers\n2) identifies geographic areas of unmet need, and\n3) encourages primary care physicians and non-physician practitioners to provide healthcare in medically underserved areas in California.
