  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents roads in North America at 1:1,000,000 scale. The roads included in this layer are either those that connect major centres of population or selected frontier roads. Roads under construction are not shown. There are three road classes: Major roads, which are divided, multi-lane, limited access highways; Secondary roads, which are all roads that do not meet the definition of major roads; and Ferries, which are major ferry links which run either year round or through periods when ice conditions permit. This data set was produced using digital files supplied by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey. This layer is part of the 1997-2014 edition of the National Atlas of the United States. The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national and continental level. These data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática, or the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.

Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/zs937jp1255. The Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) is an international organization created by Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC). The CEC was established to address regional environmental concerns, help prevent potential trade and environmental conflicts, and to promote the effective enforcement of environmental law. The Agreement complements the environmental provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Further information on the CEC is available from http://www.cec.org/ or from >Commission for Environmental Cooperation >393, rue St-Jacques Ouest >Bureau 200 >Montréal (Québec) >H2Y 1N9 Canada > >Telephone: 514 350 4300 >Facsimile: 514 350 4314 >Electronic mail: info@ccemtl.org > All North American Atlas data sets are available in four data formats: Arc/INFO Export format (e00), ArcView Shapefile, Geography Markup Language (GML) and Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS). Although these data are distributed in geographic coordinates, the North American Atlas Map uses a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection. The following parameters were used for the map: >Longitude_of_Projection_Center: -100.00 >Latitude_of_Projection_Center: 45.00 >False_Easting (metres): 0.0 >False_Northing (metres): 0.0 >Semi-major_Axis: 6370997.0 >Denominator_of_Flattening_Ratio: 1.0 >Ellipsoid_Name: Sphere >Units: metres ; {\"gdaId\" : 6065785}",
