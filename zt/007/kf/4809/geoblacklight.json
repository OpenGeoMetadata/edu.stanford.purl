  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile depicts ports politically defined by port limits or USACE projects, excluding non-USACE projects not authorized for publication. The determination for the published principal ports is based upon the total tonnage for the port for a particular year. Therefore, the top 150 list can vary from year to year. This layer is part of the 2014 National Transportation Atlas Database. The National Transportation Atlas Databases 2014 (NTAD2014) is a set of nationwide geographic datasets of transportation facilities, transportation networks, associated infrastructure and other political and administrative entities. These datasets include spatial information for transportation modal networks and intermodal terminals, as well as the reÂ¬lated attribute information for these features. This data supports research, analysis, and decision-making across all transportation modes. It is most useful at the national level, but has major applications at regional, state and local scales throughout the transportation community. The data used to compile NTAD2014 was provided by our partners within the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and by other agencies throughout the United States Federal Government. These contributors are the actual data stewards and are ultimately responsible for the maintenance and accuracy of their data. This data contains United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) port codes, geographic locations (longitude, latitude), names and commodity tonnage summaries (total tons, domestic, foreign, imports and exports) for principal USACE ports.
