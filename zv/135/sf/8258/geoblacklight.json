  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents churches in Paris from the early Middle Ages (816) until the French Revolution (1790). Some buildlings contained in this layer existed prior to 816. Each building is accompanied by attributes including proper name, start and end dates of construction, cartographic and archaeological sources, type (ecclesiastical, secular, religious, uncertin, etc.), gender of covenant residents, and time period. If a point representing a particular church is duplicated, one of the following 4 changes has occurred. (1) Geographic: represents an institutional move. (2) Name: represents an official name change. (3) Type: represents a change between religious and secular. (4) Status: representsa religious affiliation change, or when parishes are formed. For each of these changes, a new point is created (usually in the same place). Dates of the later building follow the dates of the preceeding building.The ALPAGE programme aims to provide collaborative tools for the Humanities and Social Sciences and for Information Communication Technology (ICT) allowing for the development of research about the Parisian urban area. This aim is achieved by means of a GIS that includes cadastral and historical layers.",
