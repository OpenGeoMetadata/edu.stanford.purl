  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile depicts boundaries for Land Use in the County of Humboldt, California, per the 1985 General Plan Framework. The General Plan is a long range statement of public policy for the use of public and private lands within the unincorporated areas of Humboldt County. These public policies establish a generalized pattern of Land Use for a twenty year period which is the foundation for more detailed implementation. The pattern of Land Use as represented in the General Plan attempts to balance economic and social needs of the public with inherent characteristics of the land, plant and animal life, and air and water conditions. State law requires that all California Counties and Cities adopt General Plans.The Humboldt County Planning and Building Department is responsible for protecting the public health, safety and welfare via building permit review and inspections consistent with California model codes as well as planning and development review and approval consistent with the county's General Plan. This Department oversees the Advance Planning Division, which is responsible for the Humboldt County's Geographic Information System (GIS) that is utilized by other County Departments; many federal, state and local agencies; and the general public. This coverage can be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analyses of geospatial data.",
