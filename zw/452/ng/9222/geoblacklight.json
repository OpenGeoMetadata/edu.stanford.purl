  "dc_description_s": "This map illustrates the structures potentially damaged by the earthquake of September 19, 2017 which were detected through satellite images for the Cuautepec Madero colony in Mexico City. Twenty-nine potentially damaged structures were identified within the base satellite image, of which 16 are within the administrative boundary of the colony. The analysis was carried out with a WorldView-2 image, acquired on September 26, 2017. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. It is important to consider the characteristics of the source imagery used in the analyses when interpreting results. For damage assessments it should be noted that only significant damage to the structural integrity of the buildings analyzed can be seen in imagery, while minor damage such as cracks or holes may not be visible at all. For flood extractions using radar data it is important to note that urban areas and highly vegetated areas may mask the flood signature and result in underestimation of flood waters.
