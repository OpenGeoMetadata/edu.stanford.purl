  "dc_description_s": "CCED is a GIS database defining easements and deed-based restrictions on private land. These restrictions limit land uses to those compatible with maintaining it as open space. Lands under easement may be actively farmed, grazed, forested, or held as nature reserves. Easements are typically held on private lands with no public access. CCED represents California in the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED), a national inventory of lands conserved as easements. NCED is managed by a consortium of non-governmental organizations including: Ducks Unlimited, the Trust for Public Land, Defenders of Wildlife, Conservation Biology Institute, and NatureServe. .
