  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents exclusive economic zones (EEZs) on the west coast of the United States. This layer is part of a collection of data created by the California Department of Fish &amp;amp; Game. These data are intended for researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. California Department of Fish and Game. Marine Resources Region. (2004). Economic Exclusive Zones, Western United States, 2004. California Department of Fish and Game. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/zy893sb7630. Converted to California Teale Albers Projection NAD 83 by California Department of Fish and Game, Marine Region GIS --BEGIN ORIGINAL METADATA - THIS INFORMATION MAY NOT BE CURRENT-- Content taken from location of data download: http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/csdl/eez.htm The Exclusive Economic Zone data is listed by region and is contained within zipped files. Within each zipped file, there are two sets of files-- 1) a dbase IV file containing points representing the outer boundary and 2) a shapefile representing the points as a single polyline. The dbase file has 9 fields called LATDEG, LATMIN, LATSEC, LATDIR, LONGDEG, LONGMIN, LONGSEC, LONGDIR, and SOURCE. The SOURCE field identifies the points as having been taken from the Federal Register, August 23, 1995, \"Exclusive Economic Zone and Maritime Boundaries: Notice of Limits\" (Search at the following link: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/search.html) or measured 200 nautical miles from the baseline. (Note: At this time, the EEZ for Wake Island and Alaska are not available in shapefile format.) The points that were generated from the baseline were created by a computer program which doesn't distinguish between East and West longitude. The longitudes in these files are measured West from Greenwich (even past the 180th meridian) unless specifically stated as \"E.\" This is the convention for precise geodetic computations at the National Ocean Service (NOS) and these coordinates were computed on the North American Datum of 1927. Both the current edition and these files of coordinates may be superseded by the publication of a new chart edition. These files may or may not be current. Periodically, new files will be added with FGDC-compliant metadata. The new files will include a tab-delimited text file of coordinates along the EEZ limit and a polyline shapefile. --END ORIGINAL METADATA-- None. This layer is presented in the WGS84 coordinate system for web display purposes. Downloadable data are provided in native coordinate system or projection.",
